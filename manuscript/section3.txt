# Marketing your subscription box

You have your box site set up. It might not be perfect yet, but it works well enough that people can subscribe. Now what? It's time to find some subscribers. 

Actually, it's time to start getting into the habit of marketing, as it isn't just something you do in a burst in the beginning, but will need  constant work on to keep your subscriber numbers growing.

Sadly there isn't any one easy trick or marketing channel for finding subscribers. New marketing channels pop up, old ones wither and you have to keep looking. Even if a marketing campaign works really well right now, it might not continue to do so in the future. Channels change and when other marketers catch the increased competition can lead to that channel no longer being profitable.

For example you might find that paid advertising with Google AdWords works really well for you. Say you are happily paying $0.10 a click for your niche keywords and making a profit. Over time you might find you have more and more competitors bidding on the same keywords, driving your cost per click so high that suddenly it isn't profitable anymore.

The same thing can happen to other channels as well. The key is to keep estimating how well each one is doing. Constantly keep tweaking your campaigns or look for new places to promote your box. For example I used to advertise Candy Japan in an app called StumbleUpon, until one day the owners just decided to arbitrarily increase the cost per click for all advertisers.

## The funnel

Not everyone who hears about your site will visit it. Not everyone who visits your site will become a subscriber. While this much is obvious, it can be helpful to step back and try to visualize it. 

The metaphor of choice is a [funnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_funnel), the narrowing of it representing people who leave at each step before completing their purchase.

![](images/funnel.jpg)

The funnel is a useful analogy for realizing that there are several steps, all of which are required for a sale to happen. Improvement in later steps can be just as important as pouring more visitors to the top of the funnel.

It's useful to think about this because it makes you see that you have several places which could be improved to gain more customers. You could have more (or better quality) visitors coming in at the top of the funnel by spending a lot on advertising, or you could try to convince more of the visitors you do get to actually place an order. 

There may be other reasons for losing customers at a step. For example if your site doesn't work properly on mobile, doesn't support your customers' favorite payment methods or has too many steps during check-out, those could all make people leave that otherwise may have subscribed.

Even if your site could magically get every single visitor to subscribe, that would be useless if no-one visits it. On the other hand, having a million visitors to your site would be useless if everyone drops out before completing a purchase. 

Similar is also true for less extreme examples. Having 5000 visitors to your site and converting 0.2% of them to customers will get you 10 sales, but so would having 1000 visitors if you could improve your conversion rate to 1.0%.

### Look at sales, not just visitors

If you are spending a lot of money growing your Facebook likes or Twitter followers, are you sure that is money well spent? Unless you have some way to measure it, you won't really know if you are just throwing that money away. 

Facebook likes could be incredibly valuable to you. Or not. I am only suggesting that you shouldn't simply assume that more likes is a good thing, IF you are paying to get those likes or spending a lot of time on managing your page.

Look at each channel and try to see how many actual paying subscribers it brings, not just how many visitors. Even if you do know that say 1% of everyone who visits tends to buy, different sources of traffic to your subscription box site will not be equally valuable. 

Someone who types the name of your box into Google and navigates to your site that way will be much more likely to order than someone just clicking from one random site to the next on StumbleUpon or Reddit.

To know whether a channel is turning a profit or not, you should have at least a rough idea of your customer lifetime value. 

## Customer lifetime value (LTV)

LTV is an important concept for making sure you aren't wasting your promotional efforts.

Suppose your subscription box costs $25/month to subscribe to and after non-marketing expenses you have $7/month of profit left. You also estimate that on average a customer will subscribe for 7 months. You could then roughly say that your customer lifetime value (LTV) is about $7 * 7 months = $49. Let's round that to $50. That's what a new customer is worth to you.

Here's a bit of justification why you should have a rough estimate of what your customer lifetime value is. If you are just starting out and have no customers at all, this will be impossible to calculate. In that case just keep this in mind for the future.

Each traffic source will have a different cost. Paid clicks on Google AdWords can be very expensive. Producing content for SEO or updating your Facebook takes time, which also has a monetary value to it (especially clear if you are paying someone to do it). How do you know if an effort is worthwhile, how do you quantify it?

You do it by comparing the cost of that marketing activity against your LTV. Knowing your lifetime value even roughly gives you something more real to work with. 

### Compare LTV against your customer acquisition cost

Suppose you are buying some clicks on AdWords for example. You can compare their cost to the LTV to decide whether the campaign makes sense. Say on average it costs you $60 in paid clicks to gain a customer, but from your LTV you now know that the customer will only turn you a $50 profit. 

That would mean that you actually lose $10 for each customer you get through AdWords. As you can see, knowing your LTV in this case would make it clear that continuing to use that campaign is just wasted money.

It's quite easy to delude yourself into thinking that something is working, even with no data to back that up. Just seeing that you are getting more and more subscribers each day can make you feel good ("wow, my box is growing"!), even if in reality you are losing money on each one. 

Keeping a close eye on how your cost of customer acquisition compares against your LTV helps you avoid this trap.

Similarly you can consider if the time spent on other marketing channels is wildly profitable or a waste of time. You can use the LTV value to estimate which campaigns to keep, which to expand, which to scrap or try to improve upon.

## Keeping track of results

If you don't know which of your efforts is actually producing results, how will you know what to double down on and what is just a waste of time? 

While coming up with new campaigns can require creativity, when it comes to controlling your spend on marketing, you should try to switch on your most analytical mode of thinking from time to time.

You could spend all your time doing marketing if you wanted to. There are thousands of places where you could advertise, both paid and free. You can never get to the point where you'll feel marketing is "done", there are always more opportunities. Even just the various options for tweaking ad campaigns is endless.

While you can waste money on paid campaigns, promotion through the seemingly free social media and content-marketing (writing online articles, blog posts) may not cost money, but it is endlessly time-consuming. If you know that one customer is worth $50 to you and you spent 10 hours to get that customer, you just worked for $5/hour. 

Which promotion methods to focus on you can only learn by experimenting. You can't do everything, but at least knowing your numbers helps you focus on the better performing channels.

### Setting up Google Analytics

First of all, if you have not yet done so, you need to add [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to your subscription box site. This will make it possible to see who is visiting your website, where they came from and which pages they looked at. To start tracking these, your subscription ecommerce platform probably has a setting where you can enter your Google Analytics ID. If not, you will need to copy & paste a piece of code.

Only knowing visitor numbers isn't really all that useful. You should enable **goal tracking** in Google Analytics to be able to know how your sales are happening. This means that when someone subscribes (or buys a gift card), that sale will show up in Google Analytics. 

If you are using CrateJoy, [here is their set-up guide for getting Google Analytics tracking working](https://cratejoy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202719545-How-to-set-up-Google-Analytics).

If you have your own custom system, the easiest way is to redirect your customer to a /thanks page after their sale. 

![Tracking /thanks visit as a sale](images/ga_goals.png)

After you have this set up, you will be able to see which web traffic sources brought you sales.

## Announcing your launch

If you set up your site already, congratulations, you did your first newsworthy thing by launching. 

If your concept is something unique, you may be able to get some press by just that alone. Try to get the most out of it, as it can be a lot easier to get bloggers / reporters interested in something new.

Why would you want press anyway? Because press mentions bring traffic and very valuable backlinks, which later on brings you even more traffic from Google. The social validation and legitimacy aren’t bad either, as it can help you get even more press later when reporters who are researching you [see that you're already being talked about](http://blog.clarity.fm/the-hackers-guide-to-getting-press/).

When Candy Japan launched, just the various blogs picking up the launch announcement was enough to gather a few hundred paying subscribers. We got lucky getting blog coverage without an official press release. Some kind bloggers happened to be reading the entrepreneur forum Hacker News where the launch was announced and it got picked up that way. 

When your box has just been released, the release itself can be news enough to gain some mentions on various sites. It will likely never be this easy again, so make the most of it. If you try to get someone cover your launch and they see that it was already covered some time ago elsewhere, they might think it no longer newsworthy and not publish it for that reason. That’s why it may be smart to contact many blogs in a short span of time.

### Press releases

While I didn't start with a fancy press release myself, many boxes do. It seems like worth the shot. Reporters get tons of such announcements, but you never know when you might get lucky.

And you'll need the luck! As the past TechCrunch writer Jason Kincaid notes in his book "[The Burned-Out Blogger’s Guide to PR](http://www.burnoutpr.com/)": *"Because while it’s nice to think that reporters have structured and fair processes for deciding who is blessed with press coverage, you are at the mercy of the black box that is the reporter’s mind. They’re well-versed in explaining why they chose to write one story over another, but this deliberation is roughly as scientific as how they decided what to order for lunch."*

A press release is an official statement to send to to journalists, written in a factual style with important things mentioned first. It is a short outline of what your box is about, formatted in a specific way and then sent to relevant reporters / bloggers. It can serve as the starting point of writing a story about the launch of your subscription box. 

You should write in a factual way and avoid any hype terms only designed to make your box sound awesome. Keep your opinions out and stick to the facts. Reporters have a keen sense of when they are being marketed to and don’t want to just give you free advertising. The tone should be objective and be written in the third person, [avoiding usage of “you”, “I”, “we” etc.](http://service.prweb.com/learning/article/editorial-guidelines/)

Luckily you are on the same side with many reporters. You want coverage, they want pageviews for their site. Some writers are even directly compensated for the pageviews they generate for the blog they are working for, but this still doesn’t mean they would publish absolutely anything. Especially higher profile bloggers can spend more of their time covering very important topics in-depth and are less likely to just post a rephrasing of your press release.

Even if publishing more is better for them, there is still an opportunity cost to be covering your launch story instead of something more important that could be even more popular. The content should be interesting to their readership.

#### Format of a press release

It might be the easiest to start by mimicking an existing press release to get the proper format. 

The first line in a press release indicates whether the information can be published immediately or if it is under an "**embargo**". You can use an embargo to give a date for when your launch announcement can be published to coordinate information going out at the same time. You should be aware though that many reporters dislike embargoes, so using one could hurt your chances for coverage.

To indicate that the information can be released right away, start the press release with "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE", otherwise to indicate an embargo use for example "FOR RELEASE ON JAN. 8, 2019 AT 10 A.M. EST".

After this comes the title of the press release, also known as the **slug**. Reporters receive hundreds of press releases, so this shouldn’t sound too dry. Use [action words such as](http://blog.prleap.com/archives/25-action-words-for-writing-a-newsworthy-headline/) "launches", "introduces", "releases", "announces" or "unveils" to make your press release sound interesting and newsworthy. 

After the slug comes the **lead**. This is the first sentence after the slug and should contain the “five w’s”, which are: who what where when why.

After the lead comes the more detailed content of the press release. In general the most important information in your press release should go to the top, with each paragraph having decreasingly important information. This is called the “**inverted triangle format**”.

The length of a press release should ideally be around one page, possibly two.

A press release ends with “###”. This is used to indicate that the publicly releasable information is now over. After this you should include your contact information, including a phone number at which the reporter can reach you if they have any last minute questions.

You can find many examples of a subscription box launch press releases by Googling for “FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE” (the traditional starting phrase in “non-embargoed” press releases) and “subscription box”. You can also see some of the coverage those releases resulted in by Googling for the contents of the press release with [Google News search](http://news.google.com/news).

#### Are press releases useful?

While many say that press releases are useless, it is a rather low effort activity with a potentially high payoff, so perhaps it is something worth trying still.  

There are professional PR people who handle dealing with the press as their main work, but they are quite expensive to use. For instance the subscription box [Cooper And Kid](http://cooperandkid.com/) is using such a PR firm to help boost their press relations. 

You can see their launch press release [here](http://www.cooperandkid.com/wp-content/themes/cooperkid/press/130326_PressRelease_CooperKit.pdf).
While it resulted in some coverage, it only worked as part of a larger effort to reach media influencers, with launch coinciding with Father’s Day, which was a key day for the subscription box. 

According to Cooper And Kid, whether press releases are picked up by the media depends not only on the content of the release, but by the connections and relevancy to the people handling the press. Chances with a press release just randomly thrown cold at the media is low.

### Sample marketing spreadsheet

From here on I will start giving you some ideas of places where you can promote your box. But to make sure that your campaigns are working, I'd first like to suggest that you track your efforts in a marketing spreadsheet. Hopefully you already have Google Analytics tracking set up, as that is what you will use to enter the numbers for the **sales** column in this spreadsheet.

With advertising one immediate goal is to make sales. But another equally important goal is **to learn** so you can sell even better in the future. You should record the effectiveness of your ad campaigns, otherwise you will not know which advertising channels to double down on and which ones to phase out.

The simplest way is to just have a spreadsheet, where each row represents a specific marketing attempt. You can decide how detailed you want to be, but here's the type of spreadsheet I have for Candy Japan.

![](images/channels_spreadsheet.png)

While in my real spreadsheet I have some more details than these, the above illustrates the major things you should be tracking. **Where** did you try to advertise? **When** did you try it? How many **sales** did the campaign result in? How much are those subscribers **worth** to you (subscribers gained * LTV) vs. how much did the campaign **cost** to run.

You can also optionally record the **cost per conversion** for the experiment means how much you had to spend to get a single sale. The lower that is the better. Finally to feel all MBA-style fancy, you can include a **ROI** column, which is just worth divided by cost. If ROI is less than <1 then you either need to improve on the campaign or stop advertising there.

By the way, in the spreadsheet above those are actually real numbers from some of the marketing experiments for Candy Japan. I'll walk you through the rows to explain a bit more about them.

## Reddit post ideas

In the marketing spreadsheet, several rows are dealing with experiments I did for Candy Japan on Reddit.

If you are unfamiliar with [reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com) and visit their homepage, you might be confused. This site doesn't look very professional at all, just a list of random links? But Reddit is huuuge. How huge? At the time of writing [Reddit is serving 7.55 **billion** pageviews a month](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/reddit-stats/).

The most powerful part of Reddit is the main page, which is what is shown by default to logged-out visitors. How powerful? As an example from today, the top image submitted to the site has been viewed 900,000 times in only 6 hours! Imagine if that was your brand and you could turn even a fraction of those views into subscribers.

It is attractive especially as anyone can submit content to Reddit. As long as your link gets enough upvotes, it has a chance of being shown to millions of visitors just like any other content on the site. There is no review process for submitted links, all is based on user voting.

While there are no gatekeepers for posting to Reddit, the community is self-policing. Anyone can some downvote or flag your links to make them get seen by less people. Some users have moderator powers on subreddits and can insta-delete posts they don't like.

You will want to be a good redditor by following the [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). One of the most relevant guidelines is that you should only self-promote in 1 out of 10 submissions.

### Paid advertising on Reddit

While you can post your content to Reddit for free, if you don't have a lot of time to participate in the community it might actually be easier to start with paid advertising. With paid ads you can at least get noticed and have some traffic exposed to your site and start tweaking your message.

![](images/reddit_ads.png)

After creating a Reddit account, you can start a paid promotion at [reddit.com/advertising/](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/). 

If you prefer, you can show your ads to everyone visiting the reddit.com homepage, but targeted traffic tends to be much better. You don't want just traffic for its own sake, you want visitors who are likely to actually subscribe to your box.

#### Targeting ads to subreddits

Besides the main page, there are also subsections to Reddit, called "subreddits". Subreddits are like niche forums. When links are submitted to Reddit, the submitter needs to select which subreddit it goes to.

Similarly ads can also be targeted to subreddits. You will likely want to start by showing your ads targeted to certain subreddit relevant to the niche your subscription box is about.

You can choose to enable people to comment on your ads, which might be good for getting feedback, but you will need a thick skin. Anonymous redditors are often not very polite!

Links to subreddits take the form http://www.reddit.com/**r/pics**, which is why you will see for example the "**pics**" subreddit being referred to as **/r/pics**.

Since my box is about Japanese candy, I ran many campaigns on subreddits related to Japan. For example I ran one on /r/anime, which is a subreddit for Japanese animation. You can see the stats below.

![Stats Reddit provides you after your campaign is over](images/reddit_ads2.png)

This campaign wasn't a huge success by any means, resulting in only a single sale and with only few people (0.18%) clicking on the ad after seeing it. Later on I was able to improve the click-through rate to 0.8% by just switching to a better thumbnail picture to show along the ad.

I ran similar experiments on other subreddits as well, but for my niche these were all too small to have huge results. I had the most luck running a campaign on /r/japan, which resulted in about $200 worth of sales with a spend of $130.

### Posting to subreddits

Much more attention is spent on the actual content rather than ads on Reddit. The community is actually quite ad-averse, so you can do much better by finding a way to post interesting non-ad content related to your niche instead.

Some subreddits can appear on the main page, others are only visible to users who are visiting them directly or subscribing to them. Still, even non-mainpage subreddits can have quite large audiences. 

With smaller subreddits the potential for world domination is perhaps not as great, but they may be good opportunities to get some highly targeted traffic specific to your niche. With a small subreddit there will be less competition as well, and you will have an easier time getting your links noticed.

![Searching for niche subreddits](images/reddit_metrics.png)

To find suitable subreddits for your posts, you can browse them on [Reddit Metrics](http://redditmetrics.com/). Especially the [list of biggest subreddits](http://redditmetrics.com/top) is very useful. I suggest going through the list and trying to brainstorm on each one how you could angle your box to appear as a submission there.

You can also [use Reddit's search to find subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/search). Besides searching for keywords related to your niche, another way to use the search is to look into what other subscription boxes are posting about. This can be especially useful to follow your competitor's activities on Reddit, or to get ideas what other similar boxes are doing on the site.

While Reddit has the potential of sending an amazing amount of traffic to you, redditors tend to be quite anti-commercial. Spamming Reddit will get you nowhere, but if your promotions are useful or entertaining enough, then you may be able to get a pass to post even with commercial intent. 

While there is no direct penalty for having an unsuccessful Reddit post, it IS possible to get [shadowbanned](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11ggji/can_someone_please_explain_to_me_what_shadow/) if you promote yourself too aggressively. When you are shadowbanned, everything will seemingly work as normal, except no-one besides you can actually see your posts. 

Don't try to be clever and create more than one account in order to upvote yourself, as there are countermeasures in place for such abuse, such as voting ring detection. 

Reddit [allows verified users to post up to](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/14erjc/psa_if_you_get_the_looks_like_youre_either_a/) 3 times per hour, 10 times per day, 50 times a week or a total of 150 posts per month. Users who have not verified their email address can only post 5 times per month. As a rule of thumb, consider being active on Reddit and limiting your self-promotional posts to one out of ten posts you make. Your other posts should also be high-quality to give you a good posting track record. 

Couldn't find any suitable subreddits? Here are some examples for subreddits where you might try posting, no matter what your niche is.

#### Do a giveaway

The subreddit /r/giveaways and /r/sweepstakes are for giving out free stuff. You accept entries from people who want a free box and then pick one randomly. While sweepstakes will definitely drive a lot of traffic if you have a nice prize, the quality of the traffic may be very low. 

These are visitors who are not necessarily looking to buy anything, but rather just looking for free stuff. I would suggest keeping a careful eye on how well this traffic is converting before making a habit out of hosting these contests.

There are also Facebook apps such as [gleam.io](https://gleam.io/app/competitions), which you can use to host the giveaway on your FB page and even require customers to take an action such as posting to Facebook or Tweeting in order to enter your contest. If you do decide to run a contest, it may be worthwhile to also post a link to your giveaway to dedicated sweepstakes sites such as [Online-Sweepstakes](http://www.online-sweepstakes.com/).

#### Do an AMA

AMA stands for "ask me anything". On the subreddit [/r/iama](https://www.reddit.com/r/iama) you can invite others to post questions to you. You are then expected to answer these questions as they pour in over the hours. For instance you could post "I started (your box name here) and we send (your product here) to people every month. AMA!". 
 
As /r/iama is one of the default subreddits, popular posts have a chance of appearing on the coveted main page as well. However even by itself /r/iama has millions of readers. Your AMA may be more successful if you are already somewhat well known, but there is no reason not to try even if you aren't. If your AMA flops, you can always just delete your post.

You will have more success if you respond to questions promptly, as people will be more encouraged to participate when they see you doing so as well. One of the biggest sins of an AMA is to start one and then disappear. The second biggest is to be evasive in your answers to tough questions. Just like on Reddit in general, to do an AMA post you need to have a thick skin, as users may not always be so kind with their words.

Besides Reddit you can also do an AMA on the marketing-focused site inbound.org. AMAs on Inbound need to be organized by an administrator. There is a periodic [call for participants](http://inbound.org/discussion/view/host-an-ama-for-the-inbound-org-community-closed), where interested parties can apply via comment to participate.

#### Play the InternetIsBeautiful lottery

If I'd have to quickly think of a quick win small business success story on Reddit, [ShipYourEnemiesGlitter](http://shipyourenemiesglitter.com/) quickly comes to mind. It is a service where you can order boxes full of glitter to be sent to your unsuspecting target. In mid-January 2015 the site got posted to /r/internetisbeautiful, which is a subreddit for *"awesome websites that offer a unique service"*. 

How useful was that post? **Very.** Just in the first day ShipYourEnemiesGlitter received **over 1 million** visitors. Take a look at their Google Analytics screenshot below, made available because the site [was on sale on Flippa](https://flippa.com/3783970-20-000-in-sales-and-2-5-million-visits-in-4-days-hugely-popular-viral-site).

![Amazing Google Analytics stats for ShipYourEnemiesGlitter](images/glitter.png)

Sadly (for subscription box founders) as a direct result of the huge success of ShipYourEnemiesGlitter and the influx of similar sites to the subreddit, /r/internetisbeautiful [changed their rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/3063r6/how_are_you_doing_were_doing_great_we_have_a_few/) to be less friendly to online stores. 

*"Online Stores/Paid Services/sites just selling stuff - some of these are funny, some of them are terrible, a LOT of them are people just trying to make that paper. we don't think online stores or sites that deliver cow poop to your friends are really what any of us are looking for in this subreddit. plus, there's like five bajillion of them now since the Great Glitter Gold Rush of 2015. they're far past being unique."*

It may still be worthwhile to attempt a post, just in case the mods happen to be in a particularly good mood that day. Another option is to come up with a widget or a free related service that **can** be posted and use that to drive traffic to your main site.

![](images/subreddit_rules_2.png)

#### Post from customer point of view

Instead of posting yourself about your box, have a customer make a post such as "I received my ABC box today, it was full of XYZ goodness!". You can ask the customer to make this post on /r/pics or to any subreddit related to the products you are sending. It will have to be pretty awesome to get attention, but worth a shot if your box is good enough.

#### Share your entrepreneurial journey

After you have learned something about starting your own business, you can share what you learned on business-related subreddits. Of these perhaps the best one is [/r/entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneur).

As always with subreddits, take a look at other posts in the subreddit and read the instructions in the right sidepanel before posting. Actually by reading these business subreddits you might also learn a lot! 

Besides /r/entrepreneur, other similar ones are [/r/startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups), [/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneurridealong) and [/r/smallbusiness](http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness), where you may also be able to post about your learnings. 

Sadly none of these business subreddits can appear on the main page, so you will only be reaching other entrepreneurs who may even decide to compete with your idea. Still, the benefit likely outweighs the risk, as these subreddits are quite large. I've had successful posts lead to dozens of new subscribers.
