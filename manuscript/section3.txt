# Marketing your subscription box

You have your box site set up. It might not be perfect yet, but it works well enough that people can subscribe. Now what? It's time to find some subscribers. 

Actually, it's time to start getting into the habit of marketing, as it isn't just something you do in a burst in the beginning, but will need  constant work on to keep your subscriber numbers growing.

Sadly there isn't any one easy trick or marketing channel for finding subscribers. New marketing channels pop up, old ones wither and you have to keep looking. Even if a marketing campaign works really well right now, it might not continue to do so in the future. Channels change and when other marketers catch the increased competition can lead to that channel no longer being profitable.

For example you might find that paid advertising with Google AdWords works really well for you. Say you are happily paying $0.10 a click for your niche keywords and making a profit. Over time you might find you have more and more competitors bidding on the same keywords, driving your cost per click so high that suddenly it isn't profitable anymore.

The same thing can happen to other channels as well. The key is to keep estimating how well each one is doing. Constantly keep tweaking your campaigns or look for new places to promote your box. For example I used to advertise Candy Japan in an app called StumbleUpon, until one day the owners just decided to arbitrarily increase the cost per click for all advertisers.

## The funnel

Not everyone who hears about your site will visit it. Not everyone who visits your site will become a subscriber. While this much is obvious, it can be helpful to step back and try to visualize it. 

The metaphor of choice is a [funnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_funnel), the narrowing of it representing people who leave at each step before completing their purchase.

![](images/funnel.jpg)

The funnel is a useful analogy for realizing that there are several steps, all of which are required for a sale to happen. Improvement in later steps can be just as important as pouring more visitors to the top of the funnel.

It's useful to think about this because it makes you see that you have several places which could be improved to gain more customers. You could have more (or better quality) visitors coming in at the top of the funnel by spending a lot on advertising, or you could try to convince more of the visitors you do get to actually place an order. 

There may be other reasons for losing customers at a step. For example if your site doesn't work properly on mobile, doesn't support your customers' favorite payment methods or has too many steps during check-out, those could all make people leave that otherwise may have subscribed.

Even if your site could magically get every single visitor to subscribe, that would be useless if no-one visits it. On the other hand, having a million visitors to your site would be useless if everyone drops out before completing a purchase. 

Similar is also true for less extreme examples. Having 5000 visitors to your site and converting 0.2% of them to customers will get you 10 sales, but so would having 1000 visitors if you could improve your conversion rate to 1.0%.

### Look at sales, not just visitors

If you are spending a lot of money growing your Facebook likes or Twitter followers, are you sure that is money well spent? Unless you have some way to measure it, you won't really know if you are just throwing that money away. 

Facebook likes could be incredibly valuable to you. Or not. I am only suggesting that you shouldn't simply assume that more likes is a good thing, IF you are paying to get those likes or spending a lot of time on managing your page.

Look at each channel and try to see how many actual paying subscribers it brings, not just how many visitors. Even if you do know that say 1% of everyone who visits tends to buy, different sources of traffic to your subscription box site will not be equally valuable. 

Someone who types the name of your box into Google and navigates to your site that way will be much more likely to order than someone just clicking from one random site to the next on StumbleUpon or Reddit.

To know whether a channel is turning a profit or not, you should have at least a rough idea of your customer lifetime value. 

## Customer lifetime value (LTV)

LTV is an important concept for making sure you aren't wasting your promotional efforts.

Suppose your subscription box costs $25/month to subscribe to and after non-marketing expenses you have $7/month of profit left. You also estimate that on average a customer will subscribe for 7 months. You could then roughly say that your customer lifetime value (LTV) is about $7 * 7 months = $49. Let's round that to $50. That's what a new customer is worth to you.

Here's a bit of justification why you should have a rough estimate of what your customer lifetime value is. If you are just starting out and have no customers at all, this will be impossible to calculate. In that case just keep this in mind for the future.

Each traffic source will have a different cost. Paid clicks on Google AdWords can be very expensive. Producing content for SEO or updating your Facebook takes time, which also has a monetary value to it (especially clear if you are paying someone to do it). How do you know if an effort is worthwhile, how do you quantify it?

You do it by comparing the cost of that marketing activity against your LTV. Knowing your lifetime value even roughly gives you something more real to work with. 

### Compare LTV against your customer acquisition cost

Suppose you are buying some clicks on AdWords for example. You can compare the cost of those clicks to the LTV to decide whether the campaign makes sense. Say on average it costs you $60 in paid clicks to gain a customer, but from your LTV you now know that the customer will only turn you a $50 profit. 

That would mean that you actually lose $10 for each customer you get through AdWords. As you can see, knowing your LTV in this case would make it clear that continuing to use that campaign is just wasted money.

It's quite easy to delude yourself into thinking that something is working, even with no data to back that up. Just seeing that you are getting more and more subscribers each day can make you feel good ("wow, my box is growing"!), even if in reality you are losing money on each sale. 

Keeping a close eye on how your cost of customer acquisition compares against your LTV helps you avoid this trap.

In the same way you can consider if the time spent on other marketing channels is wildly profitable or a waste of time. You can use LTV to estimate which campaigns to keep, which to expand, which to scrap or try to improve upon. 

## Keeping track of results

If you don't know which of your efforts is actually producing results, how will you know what to double down on and what is just a waste of time? 

While coming up with new campaigns can require creativity, when it comes to controlling your spend on marketing, you should try to switch on your most analytical mode of thinking from time to time.

You could spend all your time doing marketing if you wanted to. There are thousands of places where you could advertise, both paid and free. You can never get to the point where you'll feel marketing is "done", there are always more opportunities. Even just the various targeting options for tweaking ad campaigns is endless.

While you can waste money on paid campaigns, promotion through the seemingly free social media and content-marketing (writing online articles, blog posts) may not cost money, but it has a cost in time. If you know that one customer is worth $50 to you and you spent 10 hours to get that customer, you just worked for $5/hour. 

Choosing which promotion methods to focus on is something you can only learn by experimenting. You can't do everything, but at least knowing your numbers helps you focus on the better performing channels.

### Setting up Google Analytics

If you have not yet done so, you need to add [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to your subscription box site. This will make it possible to see who is visiting your website, where they came from and which pages they looked at. To start tracking these, your subscription ecommerce platform probably has a setting where you can enter your Google Analytics ID. If not, you will need to copy & paste a piece of code.

You were probably already familiar with Google Analytics, as it is very popular. Something not everyone takes the time to set up is the powerful **goal tracking** within. Only knowing visitor numbers isn't really all that useful. By enabling goal tracking, each sale will show up in Google Analytics and you can see where it came from.

If you are using CrateJoy, [here is their set-up guide for getting Google Analytics tracking working](https://cratejoy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202719545-How-to-set-up-Google-Analytics). If you have your own custom system, the easiest way is to redirect your customer to a /thanks page after their sale. 

![Tracking /thanks visit as a sale](images/ga_goals.png)

After you have this set up, you will be able to see which web traffic sources brought you sales, whether it was a mention in a blog article or someone clicking over from Facebook or Google. You could have other goals set up besides sales as well, such as tracking new subscribers to your email newsletter.

## Announcing your launch

If you set up your site already, congratulations, you did your first newsworthy thing by launching. 

If your concept is something unique, you may be able to get some press by just that alone. Try to get the most out of it, as it can be a lot easier to get bloggers / reporters interested in something new.

Why would you want press anyway? Because press mentions bring traffic and very valuable backlinks, which can help bring you even more search traffic from Google as well. The social validation and legitimacy aren’t bad either, as it can help you get even more press later when reporters who are researching you [see that you're already being talked about](http://blog.clarity.fm/the-hackers-guide-to-getting-press/).

When Candy Japan launched, just the various blogs picking up my launch announcement was enough to gather a few hundred paying subscribers. I got lucky getting blog coverage without an official press release. Some kind bloggers happened to be reading the entrepreneur forum Hacker News where the launch was announced in an informal comment and it got picked up that way. 

When your box has just been released, that in itself can be news enough to gain some mentions on various sites (as long as there is something unique about it). It will likely never be this easy again, so make the most of it. If you try to get someone to cover your launch and they see that it was already covered some time ago elsewhere, they might think it no longer newsworthy and not publish it for that reason. That’s why it may be smart to contact many blogs in a short span of time, while your box is still fresh.

### Press releases

While I didn't start with a fancy press release myself, many boxes do. It seems like worth the shot. Reporters get tons of such announcements, but you never know when you might get lucky.

And you'll need the luck! As the past TechCrunch writer Jason Kincaid notes in his book "[The Burned-Out Blogger’s Guide to PR](http://www.burnoutpr.com/)": *"Because while it’s nice to think that reporters have structured and fair processes for deciding who is blessed with press coverage, you are at the mercy of the black box that is the reporter’s mind. They’re well-versed in explaining why they chose to write one story over another, but this deliberation is roughly as scientific as how they decided what to order for lunch."*

A press release is an official statement sent to journalists, written in a straightforward style with important things mentioned first. It is a short outline of what your box is about, formatted in a specific way and then sent to relevant reporters / bloggers. It can serve as the starting point of writing a story about the launch of your subscription box. 

Luckily you are on the same side with many reporters. You want coverage, they want pageviews for their site. Some writers are even directly compensated for the pageviews they generate for the blog they are working for, but this still doesn’t mean they would publish absolutely anything. Especially higher profile bloggers can spend more of their time covering very important topics in-depth and are less likely to just post a rephrasing of your press release.

Even if publishing more is better for them, there is still an opportunity cost to be covering your launch story instead of something more important that could be even more popular. The content should be interesting to their readership.

#### Format of a press release

It might be the easiest to start by mimicking an existing press release to get the proper format. 

The tone should be objective and be written in the third person, [avoiding usage of “you”, “I”, “we” etc.](http://service.prweb.com/learning/article/editorial-guidelines/)

The first line in a press release indicates whether the information can be published immediately or if it is under an "**embargo**". You can use an embargo to give a date for when your launch announcement can be published to coordinate information going out at the same time. You should be aware though that many reporters dislike embargoes, so using one could hurt your chances for coverage.

To indicate that the information can be released right away, start the press release with "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE", otherwise to indicate an embargo use for example "FOR RELEASE ON JAN. 8, 2019 AT 10 A.M. EST".

After this comes the title of the press release, also known as the **slug**. Reporters receive hundreds of press releases, so this shouldn’t sound too dry. Use [action words such as](http://blog.prleap.com/archives/25-action-words-for-writing-a-newsworthy-headline/) "launches", "introduces", "releases", "announces" or "unveils" to make your press release sound interesting and newsworthy. 

After the slug comes the **lead**. This is the first sentence after the slug and should contain the “five w’s”, which are: who what where when why.

After the lead comes the more detailed content of the press release. In general the most important information in your press release should go to the top, with each paragraph having decreasingly important information. This is called the “**inverted triangle format**”.

The length of a press release should ideally be around one page, possibly two.

A press release ends with “###”. This is used to indicate that the publicly releasable information is now over. After this you should include your contact information, including a phone number at which the reporter can reach you if they have any last minute questions.

You can find many examples of a subscription box launch press releases by Googling for “FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE” (the traditional starting phrase in “non-embargoed” press releases) and “subscription box”. You can also see some of the coverage those releases resulted in by Googling for the contents of the press release with [Google News search](http://news.google.com/news).

#### Are press releases useful?

While many say that press releases are useless, it is a rather low effort activity with a potentially high payoff, so perhaps it is something worth trying still.  

There are professional PR people who handle dealing with the press as their main work, but they are quite expensive to use. For instance the subscription box [Cooper And Kid](http://cooperandkid.com/) is using such a PR firm to help boost their press relations. 

You can see their launch press release [here](http://www.cooperandkid.com/wp-content/themes/cooperkid/press/130326_PressRelease_CooperKit.pdf).
While it resulted in some coverage, it only worked as part of a larger effort to reach media influencers, with launch coinciding with Father’s Day, which was a key day for the subscription box. 

According to Cooper And Kid, whether press releases are picked up by the media depends not only on the content of the release, but by the connections and relevancy to the people handling the press. Chances with a press release just randomly thrown cold at the media is low.

### Sample marketing spreadsheet

From here on I will start giving you some ideas of places where you can promote your box. But to make sure that your campaigns are working, I'd first like to suggest that you track your efforts in a marketing spreadsheet. Hopefully you already have Google Analytics tracking set up, as that is what you will use to enter the numbers for the **sales** column in this spreadsheet.

With advertising one immediate goal is to make sales. But another equally important goal is **to learn** so you can sell even better in the future. You should record the effectiveness of your ad campaigns, otherwise you will not know which advertising channels to double down on and which ones to phase out.

The simplest way is to just have a spreadsheet, where each row represents a specific marketing attempt. You can decide how detailed you want to be, but here's the type of spreadsheet I have for Candy Japan.

![](images/channels_spreadsheet.png)

While in my real spreadsheet I have some more details than these, the above illustrates the major things you should be tracking. **Where** did you try to advertise? **When** did you try it? How many **sales** did the campaign result in? How much are those subscribers **worth** to you (subscribers gained * LTV) vs. how much did the campaign **cost** to run.

You can also optionally record the **cost per conversion** for the experiment means how much you had to spend to get a single sale. The lower that is the better. Finally to feel all MBA-style fancy, you can include a **ROI** column, which is just worth divided by cost. If ROI is less than <1 then you either need to improve on the campaign or stop advertising there.

By the way, in the spreadsheet above those are actually real numbers from some of the marketing experiments for Candy Japan. They are of course not the only ones I've ever done, but just a few I picked. You can easily find tons of places to advertise online and probably have a lot of ideas yourself, but I will describe Reddit and just a few other places I am familiar with to get you started.

## Reddit post ideas

In the marketing spreadsheet, several rows are dealing with experiments I did for Candy Japan on Reddit. There is no specific reason to try Reddit first, except that due to the lower visitor volume of its niche subreddits, it may be a bit easier to get your few early sales in a less competitive environment than paid advertising in places like Google or Facebook.

If you are unfamiliar with [reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com) and visit their homepage, you might be confused. This site doesn't look very professional at all, just a list of random links? But Reddit is huuuge. How huge? At the time of writing [Reddit is serving 7.55 **billion** pageviews a month](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/reddit-stats/).

The most powerful part of Reddit is the main page, which is what is shown by default to logged-out visitors. How powerful? As an example from today, the top image submitted to the site has been viewed 900,000 times in only 6 hours! Imagine if that was your brand and you could turn even a fraction of those views into subscribers.

Reddit is attractive to a new box founder especially as anyone can submit content there. As long as your link gets enough upvotes, it has a chance of being shown to millions of visitors just like any other content on the site. There is no review process for submitted links, all is based on user voting.

While there are no gatekeepers for posting to Reddit, the community is self-policing. Anyone can some downvote or flag your links to make them get seen by less people. Some users have moderator powers on subreddits and can insta-delete posts they don't like.

You will want to be a good redditor by following the [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). One of the most relevant guidelines is that you should only self-promote in 1 out of 10 submissions.

### Paid advertising on Reddit

While you can post your content to Reddit for free, if you don't have a lot of time to participate in the community it might actually be easier to start with paid advertising. With paid ads you can at least get noticed and have some traffic exposed to your site and start tweaking your message.

![](images/reddit_ads.png)

After creating a Reddit account, you can start a paid promotion at [reddit.com/advertising/](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/). 

If you prefer, you can show your ads to everyone visiting the reddit.com homepage, but targeted traffic tends to be much better. You don't want just traffic for its own sake, you want visitors who are likely to actually subscribe to your box.

#### Targeting ads to subreddits

Besides the main page, there are also subsections to Reddit, called "subreddits". Subreddits are like niche forums. When links are submitted to Reddit, the submitter needs to select which subreddit it goes to.

You will likely want to start by targeting your ads to certain subreddit relevant to the niche your subscription box is about.

You can choose if you would like to enable people to comment on your ads, which might be good for getting feedback, but you will need a thick skin. Anonymous redditors are often not very polite!

Links to subreddits take the form http://www.reddit.com/**r/pics**, which is why you will see for example the "**pics**" subreddit being referred to as **/r/pics**.

Since my box is about Japanese candy, I ran many campaigns on subreddits related to Japan. For example I ran one on /r/anime, which is a subreddit for Japanese animation. You can see the stats below.

![Stats Reddit provides you after your campaign is over](images/reddit_ads2.png)

This campaign wasn't a huge success by any means, resulting in only a single sale and with only few people (0.18%) clicking on the ad after seeing it. Later on I was able to improve the click-through rate to 0.8% by just switching to a better thumbnail picture to show along the ad.

I ran similar experiments on other subreddits as well, but for my niche these were all too small to have huge results. I had the most luck running a campaign on /r/japan, which resulted in about $200 worth of sales with a spend of $130.

### Posting to subreddits

Ads are an easy way to get started, but much more attention is paid on the actual content rather than ads on Reddit. The community is actually quite ad-averse, so you can do much better by finding a way to post interesting non-ad content related to your niche instead.

Some subreddits can appear on the main page, others are only visible to users who are visiting them directly or subscribing to them. Still, even non-mainpage subreddits can have quite large audiences. 

With smaller subreddits the potential for world domination is perhaps not as great, but they may be good opportunities to get some highly targeted traffic specific to your niche. With a small subreddit there will be less competition as well, and you will have an easier time getting your links noticed.

![Searching for niche subreddits](images/reddit_metrics.png)

To find suitable subreddits for your posts, you can browse them on [Reddit Metrics](http://redditmetrics.com/). Especially the [list of biggest subreddits](http://redditmetrics.com/top) is very useful. I suggest going through the list and trying to brainstorm on each one how you could angle your box to appear as a submission there.

You can also [use Reddit's search to find subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/search). Besides searching for keywords related to your niche, another way to use the search is to look into what other subscription boxes are posting about. This can be useful for checking out what similar subscription boxes are posting about on Reddit, which can give you ideas on things to try.

While Reddit has the potential of sending an amazing amount of traffic to you, redditors tend to be quite anti-commercial. Spamming Reddit will get you nowhere, but if your promotions are useful or entertaining enough, then you may be able to get a pass to post even with commercial intent. 

While there is no direct penalty for having an unsuccessful Reddit post, it IS possible to get [shadowbanned](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11ggji/can_someone_please_explain_to_me_what_shadow/) if you promote yourself too aggressively. When you are shadowbanned, everything will seemingly work as normal, except no-one besides you can actually see your posts. 

Don't try to be clever and create more than one account in order to upvote yourself, as there are countermeasures in place for such abuse, such as voting ring detection. 

Reddit [allows verified users to post up to](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/14erjc/psa_if_you_get_the_looks_like_youre_either_a/) 3 times per hour, 10 times per day, 50 times a week or a total of 150 posts per month. Users who have not verified their email address can only post 5 times per month. As a rule of thumb, consider being active on Reddit and limiting your self-promotional posts to one out of ten posts you make. Your other posts should also be high-quality to give you a good posting track record. 

Couldn't find any suitable subreddits? Here are some examples for where you might try posting, no matter what your niche is.

#### Glittery success story

One example success story is [ShipYourEnemiesGlitter](http://shipyourenemiesglitter.com/), a service which ships boxes full of glitter to an unsuspecting target. In mid-January the site got posted to /r/internetisbeautiful, which is a subreddit for *"awesome websites that offer a unique service"*. 

How useful was that post? **Very.** Just in the first day ShipYourEnemiesGlitter received **over 1 million** visitors. Take a look at their Google Analytics screenshot below, made available because the site [was on sale on Flippa](https://flippa.com/3783970-20-000-in-sales-and-2-5-million-visits-in-4-days-hugely-popular-viral-site).

![](images/glitter.png)

Sadly as a direct result of the huge success of ShipYourEnemiesGlitter and the influx of similar sites to the subreddit, /r/internetisbeautiful [changed their rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/3063r6/how_are_you_doing_were_doing_great_we_have_a_few/) and no longer allows online stores, so you will need to find new places to post to.

*"Online Stores/Paid Services/sites just selling stuff - some of these are funny, some of them are terrible, a LOT of them are people just trying to make that paper. we don't think online stores or sites that deliver cow poop to your friends are really what any of us are looking for in this subreddit. plus, there's like five bajillion of them now since the Great Glitter Gold Rush of 2015. they're far past being unique."*

#### Do a giveaway

The subreddit /r/giveaways and /r/sweepstakes are for giving out free stuff. You accept entries from people who want a free box and then pick one randomly. While sweepstakes will definitely drive a lot of traffic if you have a nice prize, the quality of the traffic may be very low. 

These are visitors who are not necessarily looking to buy anything, but rather just looking for free stuff. I would suggest keeping a careful eye on how well this traffic is converting before making a habit out of hosting these contests.

There are also Facebook apps such as [gleam.io](https://gleam.io/app/competitions), which you can use to host the giveaway on your FB page and even require customers to take an action such as posting to Facebook or Tweeting in order to enter your contest. If you do decide to run a contest, it may be worthwhile to also post a link to your giveaway to dedicated sweepstakes sites such as [Online-Sweepstakes](http://www.online-sweepstakes.com/).

#### Do an AMA

AMA stands for "ask me anything". On the subreddit [/r/iama](https://www.reddit.com/r/iama) you can invite others to post questions to you (publicly). You are then expected to answer these questions as they pour in over the hours. For instance you could post "I started (your box name here) and we send (your product here) to people every month. AMA!". 
 
As /r/iama is one of the default subreddits, popular posts have a chance of appearing on the coveted main page as well. However even by itself /r/iama has millions of readers. Your AMA may be more successful if you are already somewhat well known, but there is no reason not to try even if you aren't. If your AMA flops, you can always just delete your post.

You will have more success if you respond to questions promptly, as people will be more encouraged to participate when they see you doing so as well. Two of the biggest mistakes to make in an AMA is to start one and then disappear, or trying to be really evasive in your answers when people ask you tough questions. Just like on Reddit in general, to do an AMA post you need to have a thick skin, as users may not always be so kind with their words.

Besides Reddit you can also do an AMA on the marketing-focused site inbound.org. AMAs on Inbound need to be organized by an administrator. There is a periodic [call for participants](http://inbound.org/discussion/view/host-an-ama-for-the-inbound-org-community-closed), where interested parties can apply via comment to participate.

#### Post from customer point of view

Instead of posting yourself about your box, have a customer make a post such as "I received my ABC box today, it was full of XYZ goodness!". You can ask the customer to make this post on /r/pics or to any subreddit related to the products you are sending. It will have to be pretty awesome to get attention, but worth a shot if your box is good enough.

This kind of activity is taking place elsewhere as well. For example here is a post I recently noticed on a popular Facebook dog photography page.

![](images/barkbox_fb.png)

Nice plug for [BarkBox](http://barkbox.com/), while still fitting the rules of the forum. It IS dog photography after all. A nice example of how encouraging your customers to post photos you may be able to get seen in places that at first sight might seem unapproachable.

#### Share your entrepreneurial journey

After you have learned something about starting your own business, you can share what you learned on business-related subreddits. Of these perhaps the best one is [/r/entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneur).

As always with subreddits, take a look at other posts in the subreddit and read the instructions in the right sidepanel before posting. Actually by reading these business subreddits you might also learn a lot! 

Besides /r/entrepreneur, other similar ones are [/r/startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups), [/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneurridealong) and [/r/smallbusiness](http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness), where you may also be able to post about your learnings. 

Sadly none of these business subreddits can appear on the main page, so you will only be reaching other entrepreneurs who may even decide to compete with your idea. Still, the benefit likely outweighs the risk, as these subreddits are quite large. I've had successful posts lead to dozens of new subscribers.

## SEO & AdWords

### AdWords

When you search Google for something, in addition to the usual results, on the top of the page and in the right column you often also see ads that someone paid to show. [AdWords](http://adwords.google.com) is the Google service where you log in to buy such ads. 

**Warning**: AdWords is a very very easy way to burn a lot of money if you are not careful. Just set up a bad ad campaign, neglect to set up a limiting budget and forget about it for a while, only to and come back to find a huge charge on your credit card. Set a budget!

I'm not going to write much about Google AdWords here, as entire books have already been written on the topic. But I will share that for Candy Japan I was able to advertise profitably for a time by simply starting a campaign targeting the broad keyword "japanese candy". 

You can see it in the advertising spreadsheet, I got roughly $1500 worth of sales over a period of one year with a spend of $750. However due to competition bidding on the same keywords, this is no longer profitable for me. I would suggest for you to try if you can still buy ads for your own box niche. If there isn't much competition, it can work for you. 

There is a lot of tweaking you can do. Testing different ad copy or improving your website could hugely improve the profitability of your ads.

### SEO

So you buy some advertising on Google, targeting terms related to your subscription box. Google sends traffic to you and some sales happen. Great!

But you are missing a whole group of people: those who never click on ads. Reaching people through ads is also costing you a fair bit of money. Wouldn't it be great if you didn't have to pay for each click, but could have those customers for free?

SEO stands for "Search Engine Optimization", the act of trying to rank well in the non-paid results of search engines. 

I don't have any guaranteed secret that will get your box to be the top result on Google. The truth is that no-one knows exactly how Google ranks their results, except perhaps the engineers working there. If anyone contacts you promising to get you to the top of Google in exchange for a bit of cash, be wary.

**Some** general things are known about how to improve your ranking, but those tend to be things you should be doing anyway: Make a good site that people don't immediately bounce back from. Have your site linked to from many other websites which are relevant and trusted. Make sure it has a lot of good quality content on it. 

### Creating content

For Candy Japan most of the good search traffic is coming from people who just search for the name of our website. Another way to get traffic is to try to write articles related to your niche that you can rank naturally for.

The idea is that instead of spending $1 / day paying for an AdWords keyword, you spend $100 to create an article. After a few months it could rise up the ranks enough to bring you as much quality traffic as you were paying on AdWords before. Nice investment which should pay itself back very quickly. Not to mention you can now reach the group of people that would not have been reachable through ads.

It's still a competitive game though, as there are only a certain amount of searches for each search term.

Maybe you'll write a good article and get to the top. Then someone writes an even better one and outranks you. 

You'll be locked into a content battle, although one with unclear rules, as no-one really knows how Google decides which article to rank on top. But at least in theory the quality of your content is what they are **trying** to rank you for (how well their algorithm can figure that out in practice is another question).

Compared to spending money on AdWords, at least you'll now be competing in a battle that will lead to better web content, instead of just more ads. In that way spending on quality content creation at least seems like a better thing for the world than just mindlessly increasing ad spend. Assuming of course you really are putting out good content and not just spam!

### Should you have a separate content site?

While your box home page may be able to be the answer to some of the queries Google users have in mind, not all of them will be a natural fit for your main landing page. For a dog goods box you might be happy to have your home page rank well for "dog goods subscription box", but it could be counterproductive to try to rank that same page for "tools for grooming a labrador retriever". 

If you would like to targer those other topics, you may want a blog or article section on your website. Another way used by some boxes is to have a completely separate content site. For example the dog goods subscription box [BarkBox](https://barkbox.com/) also operates the viral puppy content site [BarkPost](http://barkpost.com/). 

Whether you want to have your content on your main site or on a separate one is a matter of opinion. Having them on the same site could make it less jarring to try to get people to subscribe to your box, as they are already on your one and only main site. However a separate content site may be able to garner more backlinks and shares, as it feels less commercial. 

With a separate content site you'll also have the option to start focusing on that alone, if it turns out that your content site is actually better business than your subscription box. That could be if your articles become so popular, that showing ads for other sites against them is more profitable than using the same space to push your own subscription box.

### Testing whether content creation leads to customers

If you have say a box about makeup and wrote an article about "top 10 makeup tips", you want to know if writing that article is what resulted in the sale. 

Unfortunately Google Analytics no longer shows most of the search terms that visitors use to find your website. While you can see what traffic you are getting from [Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/), that tool does not show which terms are actually resulting in purchases. Good news is that while you won't see that a sale came from a certain Google search term, you can still see which page the customer landed on before completing their sale.

After you Google Analytics tracking set up, you can pull up reports to see how many sales each article on your site resulted in. Check "Behavior > Site Content > Landing pages". Then click on the dropdown which says "Conversions" to select either "eCommerce" or "all goals" depending on whether you set up eCommerce tracking or goal based tracking. 

Now you have the data, but it's still not ordered properly. You want to see the best articles first, so click on the "Transactions" or "Goal Completions" column to see which articles are sending you the most customers. If you set up goal values, you can also see a monetary value for the article. 

For instance in the hypothetical example below you would be able to see that in one month, the article on "Why Japanese Candy is Awesome" resulted in 50€ worth of sales. If that continued in the future, the article in question would soon pay back the effort of writing it.

### Coming up with article ideas

If you naturally have topics that you know you can write content about and many people would be probably searching as well, that would be a good start. For an extremely niche topic, it could be that no-one is looking for such articles. In that case you have to research a bit more to see what might be worth writing about.

A great tool for finding article ideas is the Google Keyword Planner. After creating an AdWords account, you can find it in "[Tools > Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/keywordplanner)". Using this tool you can simply input what your subscription box is about and it will show you related terms.

Using the tool you can see what topics people are searching for. You can drill down inside the topics to look at the particular keywords and how often people are looking for each every month. When considering terms to write content for, you need to balance several considerations.

* Search volume
* Percentage of the volume your content is likely to capture
* Buying intent 

#### Search volume

![Keyword planner](images/adwords_tool.png)

For example in the screenshot above, you can see that people are looking for "weird japanese candy" 880 times per month. Now even if you wrote an article about "weird japanese candy", there is no guarantee that you would appear anywhere high enough to get any of that traffic to come to your own site. 

People are most likely to click on the top result. The second highest result will still get quite many clicks, third one still some but much less and so on. The shape of this curve is known from various studies. For instance [Moz has done such a study](https://moz.com/blog/google-organic-click-through-rates-in-2014). 

| Position      | % of clicks     |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 1             | 31%             |
| 2             | 14%             |
| 3             | 10%             |
| 4             | 7%              |
| 5             | 6%              |

As you can see, you lose more than half the potential visitors by being in the second place compared to first. Let's be realistic here: in all likelihood unless there is almost no competition for your term, you probably won't get a first result for any important term. Actually you'll be lucky to even get to the first **page** with your content. There is a lot of content out there, much of it well written, older and with a large number of backlinks.

Not that there even exists a "first place" anymore, as results are nowadays personalized to the individual searcher. If you would like to see unpersonalized results, you can try searching in incognito mode. There will still be sites that generally are ranked high in the results for most people, so the concept of a good Google ranking hasn't vanished despite personalization.

Reaching a good ranking on Google is very hard, but there is a happy side. While trying to rank for your desired terms, you are accidentally going to rank for many more long-tail terms that you hadn't even considered when writing your content. 

If you wrote an article on the topic of say "dog goods subscription box" and included some sentences such as "this doggy box is perfect for your puppy, be it a labrador retriever or a spaniel" and expected to get traffic from people searching for "doggy box", you might find that you just happen to rank really well for something else entirely, such as "labrador retriever puppy box" or another unexpected term like that. 

While aiming for the top result, you can accidentally better rank for many other terms. It's better to rank well for a less searched for term than rank poorly for a popular one. For example it's better to be the top result for something which is searched for 100 times a month, rather than the 5th result for something searched for 500 times a month.

#### Buying intent

Now you have an article and some people are even clicking through to your site after searching for some terms appearing in it. But will they actually subscribe? Having a lot of traffic might be fun, but unless they actually subscribe to your box, it is meaningless. What you want is buying intent. The difference between someone who is searching for "rolex pictures" and "buy rolex now" or "rolex discount coupons" is huge.

The idea is that when people search for topics which would identify the searchers as people very likely to subscribe to your box, you want those people to land on your site. In practice it can be quite difficult to come up with article ideas, so you might not be able to be too picky about whether they show buying intent or not, but in case you have a ton of ideas to choose from, perhaps better to go with the ones where readers might be ready to buy.

### Format of content to write

According to Moz research, the sweet spot for articles seemed to be [1822 - 2428 words](https://moz.com/blog/what-makes-a-link-worthy-post-part-1). That's 6 subheadings with about 400 words each. [Another source](http://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/ideal-blog-post-length/) suggests 1500 words. I tend to trust Moz, as one of the resources they use to gather their research is accessing thousands of Google Webmaster Tools accounts, which seems like a pretty reliable source when it comes to SEO data.

Of course the right answer for article length is likely "as long as makes sense", but if you are getting some content made by using freelancers, they will want to know how many words they are supposed to write. 

Also notable in Moz research was that "*Posts with all three media types (videos, images, and lists) will attract almost 6 times more ILDs than a plain text post*". Here ILDs mean “In-Linking Domains”, which is how many different sites link back to the content. Backlinks are one signal that Google uses to determine how high to rank content (and great because the link itself also sends traffic to you).

### Finding freelancers to write your content

If you have an idea for an article and rough bullet points on what it should cover, you can either go ahead and write it yourself, or you can find a freelancer to do the writing for you. 

Finding a lot of freelancers is extremely easy using a site such as [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com) (personal favorite) or [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/), but the challenge is finding quality authors.When you post an open article writing job, you will likely get a dozen applications in a matter of hours, but when you try to hire them you may run into some poor quality writing. 

You can help improve your article quality by hiring multiple bidders to write for you, look at how well they write and in the future focus on the better quality authors. Initially you will have to spend a bit more to find reliable help, but you can keep relying on those people for a long time.

There is also a tool called [HitTail](https://www.hittail.com/), which combines keyword research with a way to hire writers. It can analyze traffic that your website is getting and get articles written for you for keywords that look promising.

## Niche ad networks

If you AdWords seemed too competitive, you could go hunting for less used networks that still command enough audience to be interesting. There are ways to buy advertising on sites which may be very suitable for your chosen subscription box niche.

Of course you can always just try to contact site owners directly as well, but these networks make it easier to make the connection between the ad buyer and site owner. There are tons of these for different topics, as you can find by googling for "niche ad network", here are two examples.

### Project Wonderful

Project Wonderful is ad network mainly used by web comics, on which I have been able to get several affordable conversions for Candy Japan. It is a great starter network, as ad slots tend to be very cheap. Their website does look a bit unprofessional, but don't let that put you off too much, this is a great network for getting started without accidentally burning a lot of cash!

Project Wonderful works as an ongoing auction for all of the traffic to a certain ad slot. You make a bid such as "I'm willing to pay $10/day for all the US traffic to this ad slot" and as long as you are the top bidder, your ad is shown in that placement continuously. You can pick one or more of these geographic areas: United States, Canada, Europe or "elsewhere".

Besides web comics, they have some other web properties that might be too questionable for other networks to touch, such as the "chat with stranger" site Omegle or some web comics on the risque side. But the prices are great. 

Many web comics with around 100,000 daily views are available for less than $10 a day, some with ~50k daily views for less than a dollar. Compare that to buying a similar amount of ad impressions on other networks, and you could easily spend as much as $300 - $1000 for the same impression count.

![Bidding on an ad slot on Project Wonderful](images/project_wonderful_bid.png)

It's very easy to get started, as you can browse stats of different properties even without creating an account. Here's the [direct link to the top properties search](https://www.projectwonderful.com/adsearch.php?advanced=0&sort=&regions%5B%5D=1&regions%5B%5D=0&regions%5B%5D=2&regions%5B%5D=9&avguniqueusers=0&minhits=1&maxhits=&hitdays=5&trafficany=2&sumdata=1&showallregions=1&measurement=1&minbids=&maxbids=&biddays=5&mincurrentbid=&maxcurrentbid=&minbidmin=&minbidmax=&biddingany=2&button=2&square=4&halfbanner=6&banner=1&rectangle=7&leaderboard=5&skyscraper=3&namefilter=&domainfilter=&tags=&badtags=&referrerhits=&referrer=&referrerdays=1&referrerany=1&countrypercentage=&countrytype=0&country=&c=1&sfw=1&nsfw=1&adult=1&adrating=6&graphical=2&approval=0&mincols=&maxcols=&advertiser=&includebanned=0&submit=1).

### BuySellAds

[BuySellAds](https://buysellads.com/buy) is a marketplace where you can purchase certain ad slots on sites you choose yourself. You can choose which website to place your ad on and buy the whole ad space for a period of time. 

This is a bit pricier one, but has more sites that could be suitable to your box niche. The slots for smaller sites are usually priced at a certain amount per month, while the more visited ones tend to be on a per-ad-impression basis.

![BuySellAds categories](images/buysellads.png)

Many sites are quite affordable and the system is very easy to understand, so BuySellAds could be a great way to get started with ad buying. You can buy an ad slot on many of the smaller sites starting at around $50 / month. Still confused? They have a great [how it works page](https://buysellads.com/advertisers/howitworks) to get you started.

## Have affiliates do the marketing for you

You can use **affiliates** to do sales for you. These are people who can push your subscription box online in exchange for a cut of the sale.

You pay affiliates a fee for each subscriber they manage to find you.  The higher the payout, the more motivated affiliates will be to promote your product instead of others. 

Other ways to structure this is to give the affiliate 100% of the first month sale or a certain percentage of all future transactions. For instance the dating site [SpeedDate](https://www.speeddate.com/) allows their affiliates to choose between these two ways to get paid.

You can either set up your own affiliate system, or use a network such as [Subscription Box Network](https://www.subscriptionboxnetwork.com/). Perhaps the most well-known affiliate network is [Commission Junction](http://www.cj.com). After signing up for inspiration you will be able to browse other subscription boxes which are offering affiliate fees. 

For instance [GlossyBox](http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-7844888-11120723-1429714569000) is willing to pay affiliate fees for new members, starting at $5 per subscriber, going up to $9 per subscriber if the affiliate sends more than 400. Also if the affiliate sends a visitor to the GlossyBox site but that visitor leaves, if they come back later to make a purchase then GlossyBox will also reward the affiliate for the sale in that case, as long as the purchase happens within 30 days.

![GlossyBox affiliate program on Commission Junction](images/glossybox_aff.png)

One thing to keep in mind with affiliates is being a bit careful when attributing sales to them. Do make sure you are not paying too much when you cannot be sure of the quality of those subscribers. Your affiliates may not be as concerned about your brand as you are and will market it as aggressively as you allow them, which may mean even spammy means if you are not careful.

A bit less dangerous alternative to an affiliate program is a **referral program**. Instead of giving your affiliates cash, you reward customer referrals with free products or discounts. On CrateJoy you can use their [referral program app](https://cratejoy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202980689) for this. Compared to an affiliate program where you pay out cash, the potential for abuse is much less here, especially if the referral program can only be used by your current customers. 

## Need more inspiration?

There are many places to spread the word about your product online, but I wanted to give you just a few examples on where you can start easily. You might wonder why I didn't mention to Facebook marketing, Instagram or Twitter. That's because you already know about those!

Oh, one you should not miss is adding your site to the several subscription box directories out there. Those often show up in the Candy Japan sales referral stats, sending in a slow but steady stream of sales. 

I recommend trying to get listed with [Australian Subscription Boxes](http://australiansubscriptionboxes.blogspot.com.au/) (they accept non-Australian subscription boxes as well, as long as you ship there), [HelloFoxy.com's listing of subscription boxes](http://hellofoxy.com/monthly-subscription-boxes/) and [mysubscriptionaddiction.com](http://www.mysubscriptionaddiction.com/).
