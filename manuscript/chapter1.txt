# Why I wrote this ebook

## Why write an ebook in general?

While growing Candy Japan, I realized that out of all the things involved in running it, I was enjoying writing about it the most. Not only is it fun to share what you've learned, but it turns out to be good marketing as well. 

Enjoying the writing process itself and seeing good things come out of it kept me motivated to keep doing it. 

After years of running the site and writing various posts, I started getting more and more questions from others wanting to start their own subscription boxes as well. Looks like there is a slight "box boom" going on at the moment.

I realized that since I am already writing about this topic, all I would need to get an ebook out of it would be a minor adjustment in my writing direction. Approaching it like this, I figured writing a book is something I might be capable of doing. 

If you are already writing about a topic, the only difference between writing a book and writing random blog posts is having an outline. Not that even that is always necessary. Hackers & Painters is one of my favorite books ever and it is a collection of essays already published for free on Paul Graham's blog!

But why do it? Because it's a multiplier for your existing efforts. It helps motivate you to blog more, as each post is also another step towards completing your book. If you think about it like this, there really is no reason NOT to work towards a book if you are already writing anyway.

## Why I wanted to write this ebook in particular

While we were growing our own subscription box Candy Japan from 0 to 1000 subscribers, I kept writing about everything I learned while doing it.

Being able to write openly required me to adopt the attitude that our subscription box is a kind of science experiment, requiring less secrecy than a business normally might. I decided I would just share everything we learned, regardless of whether it might help our competitors or not. Partially at blame might be my tendency to overshare, but despite many competitors emerging, it has turned out OK. 

The market has expanded and there seem to be enough customers for multiple boxes to survive, even with very similar concepts out there.

Writing has also increased my willingness to learn more about subscription boxes in general, even if it doesn't directly help our box Candy Japan. For example since I live in Japan, I have not had the need to ship anything using USPS (U.S. Postal Service), but I researched the relevant discounts and prices just for this book. Who knows, maybe at one point I will start shipping from US and it would come in useful then.

Similarly I had never bought an existing business going into this, but I bought the anime subscription box FaniPack.com partly just so I could write about the experience in this book. The purchase gave me an opportunity to really learn about topics such as the transfer process, Stripe, CrateJoy and other tools that the existing box was using which we had not yet tried before.

Sometimes research has been doubly useful. This is when it has not only been something useful for this book, but has helped our own subscription box as well. For these topics I've been doubly motivated to learn. 

While I knew many of the topics quite well already, this gave me a boost of motivation to research and explore the topics better. Whenever I am writing about something which I have only read about but not tried, I will indicate as much. I can tell you what worked for us, what I have seen working for others and what I believe would be well worth trying.

By no means do I claim to know everything there is to know about running a subscription box. Actually I don't think any one person can even be an expert in all of the topics involved, as running a subscription box covers everything from web development to fulfillment to marketing.

I'm not going to shave my head and write everything with the certainty of a guru. I figured even if I manage to give you just one tip which either saves you a bit of money or nets you an extra sale, that should already be enough to justify the money you spent on buying this book.
