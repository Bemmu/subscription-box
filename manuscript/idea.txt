# Why start a subscription box?

## It's fun for the customers

Most people enjoy surprise gifts. A subscription box is not only a fun gift for someone else, but can be a way to "surprise your future self" by placing an order, forgetting about it for a while and later on be delighted when unexpected mail with a variety of goodies arrives. It's like Christmas every month. 

It can also be a good shopping experience for trying a variety of goods without needing to consciously make product selections. According to [a study](http://www.ted.com/talks/sheena_iyengar_on_the_art_of_choosing?language=en), when presented with more choice, customers may be overwhelmed and end up purchasing less. 

There is also a sense of community not present in traditional e-commerce stores. When each customer receives the same box, discussion and social media sharing over the box and its contents can take place.

## Affordable to get started for the entrepreneur

Unlike starting a restaurant franchise or other business where you have to make large investments from the get-go before you even know if you will have any customers, for a subscription box you get to send out the product AFTER you already know you can sell it. 

Besides voluntary costs such as site design, there really aren't any big initial investments to make for a subscription box. Even commissioning fancy custom boxes you can put off until after you have built a customer base to justify placing larger orders for packaging materials.

## Higher customer value than traditional e-commerce

Unlike an online shop focusing on one-time sales, a subscription box is attractive because customers agree to pay again and again for each box. Customers’ credit cards are charged automatically unless they explicitly terminate their subscription. This is the opposite way compared to typical e-commerce, where no further purchase is assumed unless the customer returns to the website to make another purchase. In a subscription box the default is multiple sales, with the immediate ending of the relationship a sad less likely occurrence.

This doesn’t mean that each customer is infinitely valuable as people do eventually cancel. At the end of the day a new subscriber for a subscription box is still a “conversion” with a somewhat known value to it, so in that sense it does not differ from a one-off ecommerce site. However it can mean that one customer is MORE valuable for a subscription box company. That means that if you are advertising using Google ads for instance, a subscription box can afford to outbid the traditional online retailer, as each customer has a higher lifetime value (LTV).

## Easier to predict needed inventory

While the amount of subscribers you have will change month-to-month, you can predict how many items you will be needing. If you send the same product to everyone on the same schedule, it gets easier still, as you can even know which items to prepare. Compare this to a normal ecommerce business where you are holding small amounts of a large variety of goods. 

You can even arrange things so that if you have items left over from the previous month, you can send it to future new subscribers as their first box. If you do this, you can reach 100% usage of your inventory. This is fantastic, as with traditional online shops it is not untypical to never be able to sell some items which just end up in storage forever or get disposed of.

As the founder of [Carnivore Club](https://www.carnivoreclub.co) said in a [Financial Post interview](http://business.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/need-recurring-revenue-think-subscription-boxes), *"From a business perspective, it’s the most efficient, flexible and easy to operate business model in ecommerce"*.

## Example box: Panty by Post

Need a jolt more inspiration for starting your own box? Here is Natalie Grunberg on how her monthly lingerie club [PantybyPost.com](http://www.pantybypost.com) got started.

> I run the successful subscription commerce enterprise [PantybyPost.com](http://www.pantybypost.com). We ship a pretty French panty every month in the mail worldwide. We have partners in Paris and an office in Moscow. How do we do it? I will reveal a few of my secrets but please keep in mind, there is no recipe to success other than a good idea mixed with stubborn, unforgiving hard work. If you are prepared to take your idea and mix it with your blood and sweat, then you may have a chance at shipping thousands of your own products all over the world too. 
>
> I started the company over three years ago, inspired by my frequent visits to France. The idea came together while I was sitting at a corner cafe admiring the French ladies and their fashion. My challenge to myself became, how do I ship a little bit of what these stylish women have all over the world. Panty by Post took shape when I returned to Canada. It started with a latte in Paris and has become a growing corporation in Canada. 
>
> My education is in advertising, marketing and teaching. I have learned my business by connecting with established business people and professionals. I have learned on the job and listened to my own innate business development skills and talents to drive the company to where it is today. The business now includes other valuable staff and we are growing.
>
> There has been a move from "bricks to click" and the power of the Internet to reach a world market is undeniable. Running an Internet business does not mean a sure thing but it does offer the kind of flexibility many creative thinkers need to flourish. If 9-5 is not your idea schedule, running an Internet business is appealing. That being said, you may end up working 9-midnight but at least you're loving it!
>
> My marketing and customer acquisition plan began locally. I started by meeting people of influence I knew in Vancouver. They offered sage advice and sometimes contacts of their own. I had a coach and together for three months she helped me create a dynamite pitch list and then off I went contacting the media in my town and then beyond. Now we have PR staff in Paris and Moscow, with more partnerships in the works!
>
> After we gained traction in the market we upgraded our site and refreshed our branding. We applied our knowledge of our market and focussed our offerings and branding to serve customers better. Our top sales periods are of course Valentine's and Christmas, but we have steady sales at all times because people always need a treat or have an occasion to buy gifts. We have been running this business during a recession but our kind of luxury is affordable and accessible. 
>
> We have a renew and refer program, so our customer retention is high. We work very hard to make sure our customers are 100% satisfied. Our business is based on referrals, so we work excessively hard to value each client. We do CPC (cost per click) ads with google but this takes a long time to tweak to get good results. We enlist the help of bloggers to do reviews and we've been fortunate to be picked up my People and Style Magazines. 
>
> Our new plans for growing the business are to expand our social media reach. We love our Pinterest board and we have a new writer on staff to help us with our blog. We are always looking for good international relationships and we're currently in talks with business people in Turkey and Brazil. Who knows, we could be creating our own lingerie line next (wink)?

# Coming up with your box idea

## Types of subscription boxes

### Sampling vs. selections of full products

Some subscription boxes contain full-price items in each box, while others consist of product samples. These are very different models, as full-price items are typically acquired from wholesalers only at a slight discount, while samples can be completely free, but come with strings attached. 

The manufacturer providing you with free samples expects you to help turn these samplers into full product buyers. Having a samples-based box basically means you **need** to also have a shop, otherwise it makes no sense for your suppliers if customers have no way to order more.

How profit is generated also differs between these, as for full-price items the monthly box itself may be the biggest money maker, while for sampling boxes the box might be a loss-leader and the real profit comes from full-size purchases made in the more typical e-commerce section of your website. Depending on how the sampling box is priced, it may even just be an advertising medium for the online store and have zero profit built in.

Some boxes are based on product sampling with the hope that customers will later come back to purchase full-sized products, which in some cases works, as for instance the beauty box BirchBox [has mentioned](http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/15/birchbox/) that after shipping a sample eye shadow palette, as many as 11.2% came back to buy the full product. For a boxes based on this model, it is possible to receive products from manufacturers for free under the understanding that by letting customers try these samples they will be very likely to buy full products later on.

### Pick items from a list with optional recurring

Some subscription boxes are fully curated with no choices to be made by the customer. Others let the customer customize their box. [ManPacks](http://www.manpacks.com) among others uses this model. Some like [Trunk Club](http://www.trunkclub.com) have a recommendation system where the box is automatically customized for each customer. 

### Skippable vs. automatic boxes

One choice to make when setting up your subscription box is whether to let the customers skip shipments. You can either send everyone the current items with no confirmation, or you might announce first what the contents are and let your customers choose whether they want that box or not. For instance [Blissmo](http://www.blissmo.com/) and [Wantable](https://www.wantable.com) let you skip months. You can find more examples of skippable boxes [here](http://www.ramblingsofasuburbanmom.com/2013/08/list-of-monthly-subscription-boxes-with-a-skip-option/).

The upside of having no skipping option is that you will be able to better predict the demand each box will have. This has a customer upside also, as some customers are subscribing to these boxes precisely because they are interested in the surprise factor and won’t even want to know beforehand what your box will contain before opening it. It's like having a birthday present each month. The downside is that customers may be less likely to subscribe or stay on for long if they feel there is a big risk that they may receive items which they did not desire. 

## Buying the perfect domain name

### Should you even bother searching for a domain yet?

Let me try to convince you to just keep going despite not yet deciding on a domain name for your subscription box.

I wouldn’t necessarily recommend spending too much time thinking of a good name to start with, because once you've done enough other work, it will be easier to come up with the name. For instance if you have spent days thinking about all the different aspects of your subscription site, planning up a prototype box, thought about what kind of customers you would attempt to attract and many other details, thinking up a good name for your box will come more naturally. 

If you go ahead and register a name first, one thing that often happens is that you may find your passion for the idea vanes, but you get stuck having the name. Every year when it comes time to renew your registration you'll feel like perhaps later on you will start using the name, so better renew your registration. Have a few more such "just in case" domains and soon you'll find yourself paying $100 / year just squatting on some unused names.

It can also be a bit of a trap to be unable to proceed just because you got stuck on thinking about the name, but if you are dead set on choosing a name first, well alright, let me give you a push and try to help you get unstuck.

### How to quickly check domain name availability

To try out different name ideas, it's useful to be able to quickly check the availability of various names.

One of my favorite tools for brainstorming domain names is called [Instant Domain Search](http://instantdomainsearch.com). It shows whether a domain is available or not in real time while you type in the name. Sometimes it does give false positives, so don’t party until double-checking the result using another tool, such as your domain registrar’s reservation page. 

If you find your favorite name was unavailable, you’re not alone with this problem. Hundreds of millions of names have already been registered. This means that pretty much any single word and many good combinations of two words are no longer up for grabs. While you might desire a short name if possible, you're unlikely to be able to register a super-short name anymore these days. Every possible combination of four letters or less is taken, unless you include special characters in the name. 

### Purchasing an existing name

Your name is taken, but does that mean you cannot have it? Not necessarily. If you have some money to spend, you can buy it from the existing owner.

If you find someone already has your name, chances are it is being held by a professional “domainer”. These are people who speculate on domain names by buying, holding and trading promising ones in the hope that later on someone like you will come along to buy it.

They may be holding massive amounts of domain names, hoping that one will end up being a hit valuable enough to cover all the costs spent on the rest. Sadly this means that they are often not very cheap. What do they cost? While many transactions happen in private, some are sold through online or real-life auction events. You can browse the prices of names that have sold in these events in the past. 

For example [dnjournal](http://www.dnjournal.com/ytd-sales-charts.htm) has such a listing, from which you can see some examples such as:

| Domain name      | Sale price      |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| HomeCare.com     | $350,000        |
| FlowerBox.com    | $55,000         |
| MegaDeal.com     | $50,000         |
| Moon.co          | £6,000          |

Another place for browsing listings is [Flippa](https://flippa.com/domains/just-sold), which had trades such as:

| Domain name      | Sale price      |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Mini-Series.com  | $6              |
| TakeSail.com     | $100            |
| Swore.com        | $2,300          |
| Cloud.io         | $45,000         |

As you can see the range of prices is huge. 

There really is no one answer to the question "what should this domain name cost"? If you happen to have two wealthy or venture-backed bidders competing against each other to secure a name, then the price is as high as those bidders can afford to go. 

### Domain name price negotiation

Besides bidding on auctions, you can also try contacting the current domain owners directly. The problem here is that it is difficult to start negotiating on the price at all if you start off with too low an offer, failing to grab their attention. This is because the owner of your desired name may prefer to avoid spending time making smaller trades when they could be concentrating on the bigger wins. They may not even bother to reply if you don’t make a sufficiently interesting offer right off the bat. Another route is to be a bit more mysterious and simply ask "is this domain for sale?" without mentioning a price.

If you do manage to get them interested, the game begins. If they are experienced domainers, they will likely try to play some psychological games with you to make you pay more. One of these is to make you believe that they are currently engaged in multiple bids for the name and that you need to outbid your competition. Whether this is true or just a trick you have no way of knowing, so you may be tempted to increase your price to outbid these possibly imaginary competitors. 

Another mental trick they might use is to claim that they acquired the name for use in a project which they currently have underway. The release of their amazing site is just right around the corner and they would be unwilling to sell the name  -- except of course they might reconsider for a considerably higher price to justify scrapping their current plans. The last time this happened to me and I walked away, the current owner still after years has not used their name for anything.

Counter-tactics to these also exist, which is why you might want to consider hiring a domain broker to buy the name for you. They can navigate these negotiations in a more cool manner since they are more detached from the name than you are and get a better price.

There are many more tricks involved in domain price negotiation, I recommend reading the blog post [How to Buy Domain Names Like a Pro](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/02/27/how-to-buy-domain-names-like-a-pro-10-tips-from-the-founder-of-phonetagcom/). Two great tips in that post are using historical whois services to help find the current domain owner and avoiding giving out any personal information in case that might serve as a justification to quote a higher price to you.

*Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.* -John F. Kennedy

### Transferring a domain name from the previous owner

If you manage to get the domain seller's attention and negotiate a sale, the transfer process itself is not difficult. When you buy an existing name, the act of transferring the domain is called a “push”. The owner of the current domain needs to log in for their registrar and then request a push through the web interface. 

You may need to send the current owner of the domain a special "authorization code" in order for them to do the push. You can find this authorization code in the web interface of your registrar. If you have your registrar set up to allow all incoming domains, then the push auth code may not be necessary.

### Securing the domain transfer with an escrow service

How do you guarantee that you won’t get scammed in the process of transferring the name? If you send the money first before receiving the domain, the seller might decide to just forget to transfer the domain to you. On the other hand if you are the one requesting the sale, then it is very unlikely that the seller would agree to transfer the domain to a stranger before receiving payment. Stalemate?

Escrow services exist to smooth out situations like these. Such a service acts as a third party to guarantee that the transaction goes through with neither side having to put themselves at risk. The escrow process can be done completely online. The most famous of these services is likely [escrow.com](http://escrow.com/). It is a US-based service which has been operating since 1999, protecting transactions with total worth of billions of dollars. 

From the buyer point of view the domain transaction using an escrow service is quite painless. When you are on the buying side, first you will receive an email saying that a transaction is waiting for you. You then set up an escrow.com account if you have not yet created one. Then you wire the payment to escrow. They will hold the payment until you have confirmed that the domain was transferred to you and only then is the money released to the domain seller.

### Grabbing an expiring name

Domain names are reserved for a limited period of time. What if someone no longer wants their name lets it expire? At first it enters a grace period for 30-90 days, during which the original owner can still renew the domain. After that it enters the redemption period, during which the original owner can still renew the domain, but there is a fee involved. If even after the redemption period is over the original owner has still not renewed, then it "drops" (becomes available). 

You might think that if you see a domain registration expire, you could just wait until the redemption period is over and register it yourself. However there are groups which use special software that rapidly attempt re-registration of these expired domain names over and over again in order to be the very first to re-register it. You will not be able to beat them manually. 

Luckily these companies are sort of mercenaries for hire. By paying them a small fee you can use their guns to get you the domain you want. If you want to know more about this subject, I highly recommend Mike Davidson’s classic article [How to Snatch an Expiring Domain](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/how-to-snatch-an-expiring-domain). 

The gist of it is that you can maximize your chances of getting your domain by instructing several of these “drop catching services” to attempt to get your name. I’ve had some luck using [pool.com](http://pool.com/) for this purpose, but there are many others as well. You can enter as many domains as you wish on their site, which they will then attempt to get for you. You can also browse domain names which will be expiring soon.

### Consider a brandable variation of your key term

In the beginning I wrote that all the good names are taken. That's not entirely true. Actually only all **obvious** names are taken. Your best option may be to come up with a new unique name that no-one else has thought of. Something catchy, with personality and branding potential. 

A non-generic name can have other benefits as well. If you have an animal name or an object in the name, then it instantly gives you ideas of what the mascot or logo of the club might be like. For example the Japanese anime box of the month club "[boxychan.com](http://www.boxychan.com/)" has a cute box as their mascot, which makes it a lot more memorable than if it was something generic such as "monthlyanimebox.com".

Another great example of a name with benefits is [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com/), an email marketing service provider which uses a chimp as their mascot. This might give you an idea: use your desired noun + some branding word as your name. Have your desired term in there along with an interesting prefix or suffix. You can put these ideas through [Instant Domain Search](http://instantdomainsearch.com) to try them quickly, but there is an even faster way. There are services where you can enter lists of words to try as prefixes and suffixes and it tells you which ones are available. Some even have those lists built in. 

The best one I have found is called [Lean Domain Search](http://www.leandomainsearch.com/). Suppose for example that you are thinking of starting a snack-related subscription box. As there are already dozens of snack boxes and many domain speculators out there, you will find that almost any good name is already taken. Entering the word "snack" into Lean Domain Search, you'll find that actually some good combinations of popular word beginnings or endings added to "snack" are still available! It doesn't suggest cute animal suffixes, but can find for example that "SnackGlobal.com", "SnackGate.com", "EpicSnack.com", "ViaSnack.com" and "SnackBoss.com" among many others are still out there for grabs.

I hope some of these tips helped you find a great domain name for your subscription box, or convinced you to stop obsessing about it until later!
# Setting up your site

For our box Candy Japan we built our own system from scratch on top of Google App Engine, PayPal and Recurly. If you are sending monthly boxes like most other subscription box companies, there is no longer any reason to build your own system. I strongly recommend using one of the many existing subscription e-commerce platforms if at all possible.

# Setting up your website

## Starting with a launch page

You have your domain name ready to go and you are full of enthusiasm to get a site up quickly. Yet you are not feeling quite ready to set up your ecommerce system. What would be an easy next step instead? 

One simple way to get started is to just put up a launch page. The purpose of a launch page is to simply announce that you are now working on this idea and to provide a form where interested visitors can enter their email addresses to be notified when you are ready to launch your actual site.

With a launch page you can begin to gather an audience as early as possible. Google might also favor older sites slightly more when ranking search results, so having your site up earlier might not hurt there either (although it probably won't make a huge difference). 

### How to set up your LaunchRock page

![LaunchRock landing page](images/launchrock.png)

A service called LaunchRock enables you to set up your launch pages easily, so you can start gathering your audience as early as possible. People can express their interest for your subscription box even before you have everything else set up. On your LaunchRock page you'll have a form where interested visitors can enter their email addresses, so that you can contact them when your site is ready. This way even early on you’ll have a website to point to when people want to know more about your project and when you finally do launch you’ll hopefully already have a list of interested people to contact. 

While LaunchRock is free if you use a subdomain such as "yourawesomebox.launchrock.com", to use your own custom domain like "www.yourawesomebox.com" you will need the $5 / month plan. That's still extremely cheap and I recommend going with the paid plan. You should have the custom domain (which you probably already purchased) as after all you would probably prefer building excitement for your own site rather than for LaunchRock! 

If you do feel that just the subdomain is enough or want to kick the tires of LaunchRock before paying anything, you can proceed with the free account set-up. However there are also other features which are not available in the free plan, such as entering custom HTML code.

![Launchrock launch page editor](images/launchrock2.png)

After signing up you’ll have access to a drag and drop site builder which comes with everything you need to collect email addresses from interested people visiting your site. Later on when your box is ready to accept customers, you can send an email to everyone telling them that they can now go and subscribe to your box. Not everyone will, but a certain percentage of visitors who entered their email probably will likely order. 

## Idea validation

First try to discover if people are even interested in what you are offering, in other words validate that your idea has legs. While LaunchRock is fine for getting a rough idea on the number of interested people and many who sign up will likely become subscribers, it's still not quite the same as actually getting paying subscribers.

The trouble with testing ideas without asking for payment is that you can’t really just ask if someone is truly interested. If you ask "would you subscribe to X if it existed?”" many people will answer yes because there is no risk or downside for them to agree and they want to be nice to you. 

It costs people nothing to agree, but they might risk hurting your feelings if they say no. As SpaceX, PayPal and Tesla (co)founder Elon Musk often mentions in his interviews the following piece of advice on getting product feedback: *"Usually your friends know what’s wrong, but they don’t want to tell you, because they don’t want to hurt you"*.

If you ask someone whether they would subscribe or not, they might say yes, but then go mysteriously silent when it comes time to complete the subscription process online by finding their credit card and actually paying. It would be better instead to have the most realistic possible test, and that is having just a simple site online where people will actually be able to subscribe. 

This differs from having your real final site open in that it doesn't need to be much better than just your launch page. Just have *SOMETHING* up so that truly interested people can show that they are serious by actually paying. You can make it better later and convince an even higher percentage of visitors to sign up, but it would be better to have something that feels real and that can be ordered.

Remember the initial site is mostly for discovering if people are truly interested in this idea, without you being around influencing them to agree to not hurt your feelings. You can still tweak pricing, your value proposition etc. later, it doesn’t have to be set in stone. For inspiration, take a look at [how AirBnB gradually improved over the years](http://foundersatwork.posthaven.com/7-important-lesson-from-airbnbs-7-rejections). 
What if you collect payments but then cannot actually deliver what you promised, or decide you don’t actually want to pursue your subscription box idea at all? While you do have paying subscribers signed up and it is sad if you must shut down, you can still cancel them and issue refunds. 

I did this once when I attempted to start a Japanese stationary subscription box Pen Japan. Although I did manage to get two dozen subscribers, I soon realized I just had no real passion for stationary! When I decided to stop doing it, I made sure everyone either got the orders they had paid for or a refund, then canceled all accounts. 

While it sucks to build up excitement and then not deliver, the alternative may be wasting a ton of time building something and then finding out that no-one cares. Which is worse, spending months of your time perfecting something that falls flat on its face, or slightly disappointing a handful of early customers, who still get refunds? If you hadn't started early, those people would not even have had the chance to show their interest towards your project.

So if at all possible, you want to validate your idea in as real as possible a way, and what is more real than actually having a site up that can accept payments? 

## Static site with PayPal subscription buttons

If you are already comfortable with setting up static websites, there is a very easy way to get started with your subscription box site. Simply put up a static site with a PayPal button on it and start promoting it to see what happens. You don’t need to automate anything yet. You can even get the shipping address from PayPal, so it is not necessary to even have any kind of address collection on your site.

### Leveraging your LaunchRock page

Actually if you tried out LaunchRock, you already have such a static site -- your LaunchRock page! Just add a PayPal subscription button to your launch page and you already have a rudimentary subscription site. If you get some subscribers this way, they are easy enough to handle manually. If you have a PayPal account, you can find the subscription buttons in the merchant tools.

![Where to find the merchant tools](images/paypal_payments.png)

To get the PayPal subscription button, first create a PayPal account if you don't already have one. Then go to the "Merchant Services" tab and choose "Subscriptions & Recurring Payments". You will just need to choose the name of your subscription product, the currency and monthly charging. After that you get HTML code which you can copy and paste to your static site, resulting in a subscription button. For use with LaunchRock, it may be easier to use the simple link intended for using in emails.

![Setting up the PayPal button](images/paypal_payments_standard.png)

Incidentally, if you already have an email list, you wouldn't even need a website at all, as you can just mail out this link along with an explanation of what your subscription box is about. That is how we started with Candy Japan. I just emailed some of the customers of my previous online store to ask if they would be interested to subscribe to a twice-monthly candy service and just included the PayPal subscription sign-up link in those emails.

Since some did subscribe that way, I was encouraged to actually do the effort of setting up a proper website. On the site we used just the same PayPal subscription button for a long time. It was plenty enough to see if anyone would subscribe. Even after we added more payment options later, it did not noticeably affect the amount of subscribers we were getting, so going with just PayPal would have probably been fine as well.

![Copying the subscription button link from PayPal](images/launchrock3.png)

After creating your button, click on the "email" tab to get a convenient link instead of an HTML snippet. You can use this simple link on your LaunchRock page to create a subscription button. First use the editor to add a button ([here, you can use mine](http://i.imgur.com/v86Zyb6.png)), then click on it to set the link to go to the PayPal subscription page. Now you have a bare-bones working subscription site for only $5/month!

![Pasting subscription link to LaunchRock](images/launchrock4.png)

By the way, these simple recurring payment buttons are called “PayPal Payments Standard”. This will be important to know when looking at documentation, as PayPal also has other ways to interface with it. Make sure you are looking at Payments Standard pages, not BrainTree or Express Checkout lest you be confused. The more advanced integration methods Express Checkout requires more technical expertise to use, but allow for a more customized experience. It is only available in certain countries, while Standard Payments has better global availability.

## Subscription e-commerce platforms

The problem with using just the PayPal subscription buttons is that it doesn't really scale well when you start having hundreds of customers. Your customers are difficult to browse on PayPal's site and there is no easy way to print out all of the shipping labels for example. 

With just a static site with PayPal buttons, customers also have no way to update their subscriptions on your site, although changing addresses and cancelling their orders is possible on PayPal's site.

Perhaps the biggest reason is that by just using PayPal buttons, you are locked into a relationship with only PayPal. If you have any trouble with them, you could lose access to your subscribers. It might also be better to provide some other payment options for those who do not want to use or cannot use PayPal.

To help in all of these matters, there are now several subscription e-commerce platforms which can offer an integrated experience for you. You can hook up different payment methods, such as credit card payment gateways so that customers can enter their credit card information directly on your site without going through a third-party service. They will be able to update their accounts and see the shipping status of their orders right on your site. Some of these systems even make it possible to buy postage stamps to print directly on your shipments with your own printer.

There are several such subscription e-commerce platforms in existence now, perhaps the most famous one being CrateJoy. I will not go too deeply into the set-up of each of these, as you can find much better information in their own documentation and websites. But just as an overview, I will list a few of the options that are out there. 

Among the most important aspects when comparing ways to set up your subscription site are:

* Provided layout templates / editor
* Supported payment methods
* Ease of preparing shipments
* Ease of set-up
* App/extension ecosystem
* Cost of the platform
* Customer-facing 

### Provided layout templates / editor

The success of your site will be highly impacted by the conversion ratio of your landing page - getting visitors to convert to customers. If you need 100 visitors to get one customer, you will be radically better off than a competitor who needs 200 visitors for the same customer. How you compose your site will have a big impact on this For this reason, having good templates that are known to convert well is important. If you use a popular system and see other successful subscription boxes using layouts similar to those offered, at least you'll know those to be a good starting point.

Besides just the attractive layout, things like copywriting, photos and video on your site will of course also have a huge impact on this, but those too will need to be laid out somehow. So either your template should already have places for presenting those well or there should be an editor which is comfortable enough for you to use.

In practice it will be impossible to know which layout will work for you, so it should also be possible to customize the site freely by editing HTML/CSS directly. Even if that is not something you want to do yourself, you should have the option of being able to hire a freelancer to do any changes which you need.

### Supported payment methods

There are many ways to pay online. You can have a form on your site where users can enter credit cards directly, just as they do on Amazon and many other online store. While this can make your site look very professional, another fine option is to take your customers over to PayPal to complete their payment. Some people prefer to enter their cards directly, others are comforted by having a trusted third party appear between the site and their purchase. Some are even [against PayPal on principle](http://www.paypalsucks.com/) (note: we have never had a single problem with PayPal after ~5 years of accepting payments through them).

When accepting credit cards directly, there are multiple gateways behind the scenes processing payments, which will affects things such as the processing fees you pay, fraud detection and which countries' cards are accepted. One such gateway is Stripe, which is very smooth to use for the customer, as their credit card information is already pre-filled in if they have previously used Stripe to purchase somewhere else, which can make ordering very easy. 

However the downside of Stripe is that while they accept merchants from most countries, not all are supported. You can see the currently supported Stripe countries [here](https://stripe.com/global). PayPal also restricts their more advanced payment APIs to some countries only, while PayPal Payments Standard (the simple subscription buttons) is more widely available.

If there is a certain payment gateway you wish to use, for example if you are based in Russia and need to use a local payment provider, then you would need to find a subscription e-commerce platform which also supports that gateway. If you are based in the US, you will have a lot of choice. In some countries you might be happy just to find any working way for accepting payments. For example in my case as a sole-proprietor foreigner living in Japan, I couldn't initially find any gateway which would accept my strange situation, until I found [WireCard](https://www.wirecard.com/).

### Ease of preparing shipments

Actually shipping out stuff is a repetitive step which you will need to do every single month (if not more). It should be as easy as possible to print out multiple shipping labels in one batch. You definitely don't want to have to write labels by hand once you get past a few dozen subscribers. After a few hundred, even clicking one-by-one to generate each label starts to get tedious. If you are shipping abroad, you may also desire a way to fill any customs labels easily.

### Ease of set-up

While other aspects will dominate in importance over time, ease of set-up is still very important, as otherwise you might not get started with your club at all. You are much more likely to remain motivated to continue with your project if you can get the first few subscribers easily. That means setting up a simple site which can accept payments should be as painless as possible. If you are working on this project alone, your likelihood of going through with it will be much less if you need to set up your own server and configure software to get started. Most popular solutions nowadays gladly require no such efforts.

### App/extension ecosystem

One reason I don't own an obscure smartphone is that any apps I would want to use would quite likely not be available for it. I would rather have a more popular device such as Android or an iPhone, so that I can have access to all the cool and useful apps out there. As phones have their own app ecosystems, likely the same will emerge for subscription e-commerce platforms as well. This is not a big consideration at the moment, but going with a well-known provider which has a good developer community will make it more likely that any useful add-ons will be available to you in the future.

### Cost of the platform

You might be tempted to focus on the cost alone, but it is one of the less important aspects to consider. For example if platform A costs $50 / month and platform B is $100 / month, if B brought you just one extra customer each month or saved just a bit of your time, then it would very likely already be worth the difference.

The systems tend to be priced such that the cost scales as your customer base grows, often with a base fee and an additional per-transaction fee. $39.00 per month + 1.25% + $0.10 per transaction. If you had 100 subscribers paying $29 each month, that would mean CrateJoy costs you $39.00 + (100*$29)*0.0125 + 100 * $0.10 = $85.25.

Really any of the commonly available platforms are cheap enough that the cost is not much of an issue and your expenses will be likely dominated by other costs such as shipping and marketing expenses.

Only if you started custom building a completely new system by hiring programmers would you really start feeling the pain. If you hired an experienced west-coast US freelance developer for 6 months to develop your site, that alone might cost nearly $100k. You should feel very lucky that there are already platforms that accomplish the same with a fraction of the cost of custom development.

## CrateJoy

Founded is an Austin, Texas based subscription e-commerce company founded by Amir Elaguizy. In addition to the CrateJoy system itself, they also run [Subscription School](http://subscriptionschool.com/), which is an excellent resource for monthly box entrepreneurs. Actually, you should probably be reading that site instead of this book if you have decided to go with CrateJoy.

CrateJoy was started as part of the startup incubator Y Combinator (which by the way accepts applications [here](http://www.ycombinator.com/) in case you need funding, although it is not easy to get accepted). In each funding round they have multiple companies receiving investment simultaneously and attending startup dinners together. 

Amir was [inspired to start CrateJoy](http://socialnerdia.com/blog/cratejoy-founder-amir-elaguizy) upon noticing how well subscription box companies were doing and how despite their successes there was still no good solution available yet for running them. Many subscription box startups were operating their businesses using various systems not really geared for subscription sites. They were specifically targeting to make a better solution than the Shopify + Chargify combination.

### Comparison of CrateJoy vs. our home-grown system

For over 4 years we have also been running our subscription box Candy Japan with a self-made system, until recently giving CrateJoy a try. It was not really a switch per se, rather we bought an existing site which was already running on it. When recently acquiring our second subscription site, a monthly Japanese anime box called [FaniPack](http://www.fanipack.com), we started also using CrateJoy. I must say it has been a joy so far, although at the time of writing we had only been using it for one month. 

Compared with our own system, CrateJoy provides quite a natural interface for managing subscriptions. With an in-house system, you tend not to really care much about how nice your user interface is. And when you’re the only one using it, at first it doesn’t really matter. But when you keep using your system for years and then eventually want to have other people helping you or want to even sell your business, it starts to matter much more. CrateJoy is a lot more pleasant to use than our in-house one, which lacks even navigation menus (hey, I can remember the URLs!).

In addition to subscription products, CrateJoy also offers traditional ecommerce-style one-time products, so you can also have a shop on your site. The joy of browsing all the configuration options in a beautifully crafted interface is palpable after using a quickly mashed up home-grown system for years. While having a detailed CrateJoy set-up guide might be a good addition to this book, it could never be as up to date and authoritative as [their own tutorials](http://subscriptionschool.com/), so I suggest going directly to the source to learn more about CrateJoy if you are interested in choosing them.

### Managing shipments through CrateJoy

Through the CrateJoy interface you are able to see what you are supposed to ship in the current time period and any confirmed orders you have for future months. You can have confirmed future orders, because in addition to month-to-month payments, through CrateJoy it is easy to also accept pre-payments for several months in advance. 

These show up in the list of shipments to complete even before that month arrives, in case you want to prepare the boxes in advance. Future confirmed orders can occur in case you have multiple month subscriptions. For example if it is before the July box cut-off date and a customer puts in a 3-month box order, then you would already be able to see them as a confirmed order for August as well. 

However if the subscriber is paying monthly, then their order would not show up until the rebill has not gone through. This is because they might still cancel or their credit card could stop working before the payment has a chance to clear, so it is not certain yet if there really will be an order.

If you happen to have a need to prepare and/or send shipments to active subscribers whose rebill has not gone through yet, you can always export the list of subscribers and filter it to only active subscribers by importing the CSV file to a spreadsheet program or using a [simple script](https://github.com/Bemmu/cratejoy-scripts).

An interesting feature is that you can print labels *including postage* directly from the app. Instead of affixing stamps to your boxes yourself or have the post office measure and stamp them, proof of stamp payment is printed out as QR codes on the label. That means you can neatly have just one label for the recipient and sender addresses with postage included in it as well.

### CrateJoy supported payment gateways

The default gateway offered on CrateJoy is Stripe and you are highly encouraged to use it. While it is unlikely to be a coincidence that both Stripe and CrateJoy are backed by the same startup accelerator, Stripe also genuinely seems like a very good choice for accepting payments. 

In addition to Stripe, CrateJoy also supports the payment gateways Authorize.net, PayTrace, BrainTree, PayMill, WorldPay and CyberSource. However [Stripe support suggests going with Stripe](https://cratejoy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201885619-What-payment-processors-does-Cratejoy-support-) in these words: *"We strongly recommend usage of Stripe and will only enable a non-stripe payment processor when there is a good reason to do so (such as being in a non-stripe supported country)."*.

While Stripe payments can be accepted from any country, you as the merchant must be located in a country supported by Stripe. At the time of writing the supported merchant countries were Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. There are other countries where Stripe is in beta. You can find the up-to-date list on [Stripe's site](https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-countries-does-stripe-support).

One of the best things about Stripe is that if your potential customer has already bought something from another site using the Stripe gateway, they can prefill their credit card details. This means that to order the customer won't have to refill their CC number, but it can be a matter of just clicking "OK". This is fantastic, as the less friction you have in your checkout flow the better in terms of your conversion rate from visitor to customer.

### Cost of CrateJoy

### CrateJoy templates / editor

CrateJoy has a "design store" where you can purchase site templates for use in your subscription box site. After you purchase and install a template, you can edit the text and images to your liking via a visual editor, called the "designer". If needed, even images can be edited directly on CrateJoy, as they integrate the browser-based Aviary image editor.

![CrateJoy designer](images/cratejoy_designer.png)

HTML/CSS can also be freely edited using the built-in code editor, or by accessing it through FTP. CrateJoy uses the jinja templating language. Sections can be marked as editable, which makes it possible to change them via the designer, without touching the code.

### CrateJoy apps

At the time of writing CrateJoy had an app store with 9 apps in it. As the service is growing rapidly, the growth of the app store looks promising. Most of the apps are free, with only adding a referral program through the appropriately named "Referral Program" app costing an additional $99/month to use.

## Subbly

Subbly is a subscription e-commerce platform, founded by Stefan Pretty. It is designed to help make starting a subscription business as painless as possible. They pride themselves on great support, including personal help to grow your business. While this might be a time-limited offer, when I set up my own Subbly test site I was offered a free consultation session with the founder.

# Fulfillment

Of all the tasks for our twice-monthly candy box Candy Japan, fulfillment was the easiest to delegate. It is purely manual labor. Fold a box, insert stuff, attach stickers and tape. It can be taught to anyone in 10 minutes. You can either do fulfillment in-house (by yourself or hiring help) or hire an outside third-party logistics company.

Before the fulfillment batch can begin, some effort is required to gather the list of addresses and sanity-check that the entered addresses and amounts make sense. This will require some knowledge of how your subscription e-commerce system works. I still prefer to do this myself, as the risk of shipping to hundreds of people mistakenly is just too expensive a mistake to make. On the other hand leaving people out of the shipping list accidentally is another bad one! Because both of these mistakes are rather nasty, I prefer to do the task myself so that I'll have no-one else to blame in case I do it wrong.

# Marketing

Now you have your idea and your site is set up, now what? Well, you have to tell the world about it. Whether anyone will know that your box exists really makes or breaks it. Still, this does not mean that you should blindly go out and throw money at advertising! That would be an expensive mistake.

Even if you are normally more fond of intuitive thinking rather than very strategic and logical, this is one field in which you should know a few things before jumping in. The two most important concepts are the **funnel** and **customer lifetime value (LTV)**. If you spend money on ads without setting things up to measure the effect properly, you may later regret not getting the full benefit out of your ad experiment.

You could spend all your time doing marketing if you wanted to. There are thousands of places where you could advertise, both paid and free. You can never get to the point where you'll feel marketing is "done", there are always more opportunities. Even just the options to tweak ad campaigns are endless. On the other hand, marketing through the seemingly free social media and content-marketing channels is an endlessly time-consuming task as well. Somewhere between these paid and free channels is providing free sample boxes for bloggers, which ends up taking time just to evaluate which blogs are worth sending to and keeping in touch with them to maintain relationships. Knowing your numbers helps you focus on better performing channels.

With advertising one goal is to make sales. But another equally important goal is **to learn**. You must record the effectiveness of your ad campaigns, otherwise you will not know which advertising channels to double down on and which ones to phase out -- knowledge too valuable to simply throw away due to impatience.

# Customer support

Customer support gets tiresome, as you are often dealing with very similar issues. If you are using a home-grown system, you may find that the information you need to answer these question is buried somewhere in a database which only you understand, which makes outsourcing this more challenging. This is one good reason to use a ready-made subscription management system such as CrateJoy or Subbly. Besides just the usual support questions, there are always new situations occurring which can only be answered by you, meaning with a somewhat successful box you will always end up having some email to answer yourself every day.

For instance I often find myself having to dig for some information manually in our database or try to make educated guesses when a customer requests something to be done, but is emailing from a different address than the one they registered with. These examples sound bad and probably make you feel like “well, that should be easily fixable”. And they are, which is part of the support task, improving things so that those things will no longer get asked.

# Other tasks for running a subscription box

## Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping is required for you to be able to correctly pay taxes and have some picture of whether you are making any profit with your box. It involves mostly storing offline and online receipts and entering their information into spreadsheets. Even with a hired bookkeeper you still end up doing some of this, as when for instance you make an order for some product which will be included in the box, you will be the one who gets the receipt. 

When you sign up for an online product such as CrateJoy or ZenDesk, those receipts will get sent to your account. Each month you will need to find all these receipts and summarize them somehow for your books. Last month for out subscription box Candy Japan I had 50 receipts for various purchases and online services and just summarizing this for my bookkeeper takes several evenings to do. Mostly because it is such a dull task it is very easy to get distracted while doing it! Luckily this task at least has a well-defined end to it, but it keeps repeating each month.

We are paying a bookkeeper, but that doesn’t mean you never need to deal with the issue. You must still be able to explain each receipt and HAVE each receipt. Each time you pay for something online, you have to figure out how to get the receipt for that later. You may be using an email system, a hosting site, buy tape and envelopes online, perhaps travel somewhere and use cash to buy your tickets etc. and for all of these things you will need to have the receipts and organize them in some way. 

## Curating items

Curation is about finding the items to put in your box. Not every item you can think of is necessarily possible to purchase by you in the desired quantities. You might have a dream box in mind, but find out that half of the items have already been discontinued and are no longer available. Some might be available only in awkward quantities, such as a box of 200 pieces when all you needed was 150. 

These limitations mean that to find a box containing 5 items, you might need to investigate more than 10 to be able to settle down to 5 which are practically possible. This can be made easier by using a catalogue of products which you know are available. Curation can be a bit tricky because of these limitations, but it is definitely one of the more fun parts of running a box.

In [an interview](http://www.mysubscriptionaddiction.com/2013/11/how-to-start-a-subscription-box-company.html) Sam Gold, founder of the snack box Yumvelope, listed the following sources for new items for their boxes: suggestions received via email from brands, suggestions from customers, attending trade shows and searching for products online.

For us at Candy Japan our selection has always been by searching physical and online stores in Japan, as despite our service being covered well in Japan, we have never received a single email from a brand suggesting their products to us. That's probably because our site is completely in English and we only send products manufactured by Japanese companies!

When you are first starting out, it might make sense to just buy your items at full retail price. I haven't lost my mind, hear me out. If you are buying $200 worth of product for this month’s boxes, buying at wholesale would save you about $60. Now how much time and effort will you spend on finding that wholesaler. If it's more than an hour, then it's probably not time well spent, unless you are going to be buying from them in the future as well. If you are anticipating hours of searching and phone calls, perhaps this time would be better spent on marketing your box instead. 

The time to switch to wholesale will come naturally, at least at the point when normal stores just don't have enough to sell you. Even then talking to the store owner may let you continue that route a bit longer and you may be able to negotiate a discount that will be around halfway between the wholesale price and store price.

As long as you have enough leeway (multiple possible manufacturers) in the types of items you are planning to put into your subscription box, you can always find a wholesaler later on. If on the other hand your product is only focused on a specific manufacturer's products, for instance say "Beanie Baby of The Month" or "Hard Rock Cafe Shirt of the Month", it may be best to get wholesale approval first. Otherwise your entire operation could be sunk later by the inability to acquire enough of the product.

## The fun parts

After all of the above tasks are dealt with, comes what at least to me is the most fun part: expansion! This means discovering new marketing channels to try, optimizing your homepage for conversions, improving your box, hiring staff, including new types of inserts in your box etc. things which will change the month-to-month operation, hopefully for the better. Perhaps you could increase the variety of your subscription plans or start/acquire completely new lines of business. 

It is also quite enjoyable to think of ways to improve operations, such as eliminating some steps required for putting together your box or finding a way to otherwise not do something you were previously having to do every month. Before running a subscription box I never thought I would get so excited about reading up on different ways to do shipping labels more efficiently.

This sort of improvement is very useful for your sanity as well, as it will make you feel optimism: "ah, things can get better". But soon the next repetitive monthly tasks are around again and you go from floating on your idea cloud back to the trenches; and the cycle continues.
