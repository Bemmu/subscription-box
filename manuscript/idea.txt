# Why start a subscription box?

## Affordable to get started

Unlike starting a restaurant franchise or other business where you have to make large investments from the get-go before you even know if you will have any customers, for a subscription box you get to send out the product AFTER you already know you can sell it. 

Besides voluntary costs such as site design, there really aren't any big initial investments to make for a subscription box. Even commissioning fancy custom boxes you can put off until after you have built a customer base to justify placing larger orders for packaging materials.

## Higher customer value than traditional e-commerce

Unlike an online shop focusing on one-time sales, a subscription box is attractive because customers agree to pay again and again for each box. Customers’ credit cards are charged automatically unless they explicitly terminate their subscription. This is the opposite way compared to typical e-commerce, where no further purchase is assumed unless the customer returns to the website to make another purchase. In a subscription box the default is multiple sales, with the immediate ending of the relationship a sad less likely occurrence.

This doesn’t mean that each customer is infinitely valuable as people do eventually cancel. At the end of the day a new subscriber for a subscription box is still a “conversion” with a somewhat known value to it, so in that sense it does not differ from a one-off ecommerce site. However it can mean that one customer is MORE valuable for a subscription box company. That means that if you are advertising using Google ads for instance, a subscription box can afford to outbid the traditional online retailer, as each customer has a higher lifetime value (LTV).

## Easier to predict needed inventory

While the amount of subscribers you have will change month-to-month, you can predict how many items you will be needing. If you send the same product to everyone on the same schedule, it gets easier still, as you can even know which items to prepare. Compare this to a normal ecommerce business where you are holding small amounts of a large variety of goods. 

You can even arrange things so that if you have items left over from the previous month, you can send it to future new subscribers as their first box. If you do this, you can reach 100% usage of your inventory. This is fantastic, as with traditional online shops it is not untypical to never be able to sell some items which just end up in storage forever or get disposed of.

## Example box: Panty by Post

Need a jolt more inspiration for starting your own box? Here is Natalie Grunberg on how her monthly lingerie club [PantybyPost.com](http://www.pantybypost.com) got started.

> I run the successful subscription commerce enterprise [PantybyPost.com](http://www.pantybypost.com). We ship a pretty French panty every month in the mail worldwide. We have partners in Paris and an office in Moscow. How do we do it? I will reveal a few of my secrets but please keep in mind, there is no recipe to success other than a good idea mixed with stubborn, unforgiving hard work. If you are prepared to take your idea and mix it with your blood and sweat, then you may have a chance at shipping thousands of your own products all over the world too. 
>
> I started the company over three years ago, inspired by my frequent visits to France. The idea came together while I was sitting at a corner cafe admiring the French ladies and their fashion. My challenge to myself became, how do I ship a little bit of what these stylish women have all over the world. Panty by Post took shape when I returned to Canada. It started with a latte in Paris and has become a growing corporation in Canada. 
>
> My education is in advertising, marketing and teaching. I have learned my business by connecting with established business people and professionals. I have learned on the job and listened to my own innate business development skills and talents to drive the company to where it is today. The business now includes other valuable staff and we are growing.
>
> There has been a move from "bricks to click" and the power of the Internet to reach a world market is undeniable. Running an Internet business does not mean a sure thing but it does offer the kind of flexibility many creative thinkers need to flourish. If 9-5 is not your idea schedule, running an Internet business is appealing. That being said, you may end up working 9-midnight but at least you're loving it!
>
> My marketing and customer acquisition plan began locally. I started by meeting people of influence I knew in Vancouver. They offered sage advice and sometimes contacts of their own. I had a coach and together for three months she helped me create a dynamite pitch list and then off I went contacting the media in my town and then beyond. Now we have PR staff in Paris and Moscow, with more partnerships in the works!
>
> After we gained traction in the market we upgraded our site and refreshed our branding. We applied our knowledge of our market and focussed our offerings and branding to serve customers better. Our top sales periods are of course Valentine's and Christmas, but we have steady sales at all times because people always need a treat or have an occasion to buy gifts. We have been running this business during a recession but our kind of luxury is affordable and accessible. 
>
> We have a renew and refer program, so our customer retention is high. We work very hard to make sure our customers are 100% satisfied. Our business is based on referrals, so we work excessively hard to value each client. We do CPC (cost per click) ads with google but this takes a long time to tweak to get good results. We enlist the help of bloggers to do reviews and we've been fortunate to be picked up my People and Style Magazines. 
>
> Our new plans for growing the business are to expand our social media reach. We love our Pinterest board and we have a new writer on staff to help us with our blog. We are always looking for good international relationships and we're currently in talks with business people in Turkey and Brazil. Who knows, we could be creating our own lingerie line next (wink)?

# Coming up with your box idea

## Types of subscription boxes

### Sampling vs. selections of full products

Some subscription boxes contain full-price items in each box, while others consist of product samples. These are very different models, as full-price items are typically acquired from wholesalers only at a slight discount, while samples can be completely free, but come with strings attached. 

The manufacturer providing you with free samples expects you to help turn these samplers into full product buyers. Having a samples-based box basically means you **need** to also have a shop, otherwise it makes no sense for your suppliers if customers have no way to order more.

How profit is generated also differs between these, as for full-price items the monthly box itself may be the biggest money maker, while for sampling boxes the box might be a loss-leader and the real profit comes from full-size purchases made in the more typical e-commerce section of your website. Depending on how the sampling box is priced, it may even just be an advertising medium for the online store and have zero profit built in.

### Pick items from a list with optional recurring

Some subscription boxes are fully curated with no choices to be made by the customer. Others let the customer customize their box. [ManPacks](http://www.manpacks.com) among others uses this model. 

Some like [Trunk Club](http://www.trunkclub.com) have a recommendation system where the box is automatically customized for each customer. 

### Skippable vs. automatic boxes

One choice to make when setting up your subscription box is whether to let the customers skip shipments. You can either send everyone the current items with no confirmation, or you might announce first what the contents are and let your customers choose whether they want that box or not. For instance [Blissmo](http://www.blissmo.com/) and [Wantable](https://www.wantable.com) let you skip months. You can find more examples of skippable boxes [here](http://www.ramblingsofasuburbanmom.com/2013/08/list-of-monthly-subscription-boxes-with-a-skip-option/).

The upside of having no skipping option is that you will be able to better predict the demand each box will have. This has a customer upside also, as some customers are subscribing to these boxes precisely because they are interested in the surprise factor and won’t even want to know beforehand what your box will contain before opening it. It's like having a birthday present each month. The downside is that customers may be less likely to subscribe or stay on for long if they feel there is a big risk that they may receive items which they did not desire. 

### Automatic monthly surprise

## Buying the perfect domain name

### Should you even bother searching for a domain yet?

Let me try to convince you to just keep going despite not yet deciding on a domain name for your subscription box.

I wouldn’t necessarily recommend spending too much time thinking of a good name to start with, because once you've done enough other work, it will be easier to come up with the name. For instance if you have spent days thinking about all the different aspects of your subscription site, planning up a prototype box, thought about what kind of customers you would attempt to attract and many other details, thinking up a good name for your box will come more naturally. 

If you go ahead and register a name first, one thing that often happens is that you may find your passion for the idea vanes, but you get stuck having the name. Every year when it comes time to renew your registration you'll feel like perhaps later on you will start using the name, so better renew your registration. Have a few more such "just in case" domains and soon you'll find yourself paying $100 / year just squatting on some unused names.

It can also be a bit of a trap to be unable to proceed just because you got stuck on thinking about the name, but if you are dead set on choosing a name first, well alright, let me give you a push and try to help you get unstuck.

### How to quickly check domain name availability

To try out different name ideas, it's useful to be able to quickly check the availability of various names.

One of my favorite tools for brainstorming domain names is called [Instant Domain Search](http://instantdomainsearch.com). It shows whether a domain is available or not in real time while you type in the name. Sometimes it does give false positives, so don’t party until double-checking the result using another tool, such as your domain registrar’s reservation page. 

If you find your favorite name was unavailable, you’re not alone with this problem. Hundreds of millions of names have already been registered. This means that pretty much any single word and many good combinations of two words are no longer up for grabs. While you might desire a short name if possible, you're unlikely to be able to register a super-short name anymore these days. Every possible combination of four letters or less is taken, unless you include special characters in the name. 

### Purchasing an existing name

Your name is taken, but does that mean you cannot have it? Not necessarily. If you have some money to spend, you can buy it from the existing owner.

If you find someone already has your name, chances are it is being held by a professional “domainer”. These are people who speculate on domain names by buying, holding and trading promising ones in the hope that later on someone like you will come along to buy it.

They may be holding massive amounts of domain names, hoping that one will end up being a hit valuable enough to cover all the costs spent on the rest. Sadly this means that they are often not very cheap. What do they cost? While many transactions happen in private, some are sold through online or real-life auction events. You can browse the prices of names that have sold in these events in the past. 

For example [dnjournal](http://www.dnjournal.com/ytd-sales-charts.htm) has such a listing, from which you can see some examples such as:

| Domain name      | Sale price      |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| HomeCare.com     | $350,000        |
| FlowerBox.com    | $55,000         |
| MegaDeal.com     | $50,000         |
| Moon.co          | £6,000          |

Another place for browsing listings is [Flippa](https://flippa.com/domains/just-sold), which had trades such as:

| Domain name      | Sale price      |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Mini-Series.com  | $6              |
| TakeSail.com     | $100            |
| Swore.com        | $2,300          |
| Cloud.io         | $45,000         |

As you can see the range of prices is huge. 

There really is no one answer to the question "what should this domain name cost"? If you happen to have two wealthy or venture-backed bidders competing against each other to secure a name, then the price is as high as those bidders can afford to go. 

### Domain name price negotiation

Besides bidding on auctions, you can also try contacting the current domain owners directly. The problem here is that it is difficult to start negotiating on the price at all if you start off with too low an offer, failing to grab their attention. This is because the owner of your desired name may prefer to avoid spending time making smaller trades when they could be concentrating on the bigger wins. They may not even bother to reply if you don’t make a sufficiently interesting offer right off the bat. Another route is to be a bit more mysterious and simply ask "is this domain for sale?" without mentioning a price.

If you do manage to get them interested, the game begins. If they are experienced domainers, they will likely try to play some psychological games with you to make you pay more. One of these is to make you believe that they are currently engaged in multiple bids for the name and that you need to outbid your competition. Whether this is true or just a trick you have no way of knowing, so you may be tempted to increase your price to outbid these possibly imaginary competitors. 

Another mental trick they might use is to claim that they acquired the name for use in a project which they currently have underway. The release of their amazing site is just right around the corner and they would be unwilling to sell the name  -- except of course they might reconsider for a considerably higher price to justify scrapping their current plans. The last time this happened to me and I walked away, the current owner still after years has not used their name for anything.

Counter-tactics to these also exist, which is why you might want to consider hiring a domain broker to buy the name for you. They can navigate these negotiations in a more cool manner since they are more detached from the name than you are and get a better price.

There are many more tricks involved in domain price negotiation, I recommend reading the blog post [How to Buy Domain Names Like a Pro](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/02/27/how-to-buy-domain-names-like-a-pro-10-tips-from-the-founder-of-phonetagcom/). Two great tips in that post are using historical whois services to help find the current domain owner and avoiding giving out any personal information in case that might serve as a justification to quote a higher price to you.

*Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.* -John F. Kennedy

### Transferring a domain name from the previous owner

If you manage to get the domain seller's attention and negotiate a sale, the transfer process itself is not difficult. When you buy an existing name, the act of transferring the domain is called a “push”. The owner of the current domain needs to log in for their registrar and then request a push through the web interface. 

You may need to send the current owner of the domain a special "authorization code" in order for them to do the push. You can find this authorization code in the web interface of your registrar. If you have your registrar set up to allow all incoming domains, then the push auth code may not be necessary.

### Securing the domain transfer with an escrow service

How do you guarantee that you won’t get scammed in the process of transferring the name? If you send the money first before receiving the domain, the seller might decide to just forget to transfer the domain to you. On the other hand if you are the one requesting the sale, then it is very unlikely that the seller would agree to transfer the domain to a stranger before receiving payment. Stalemate?

Escrow services exist to smooth out situations like these. Such a service acts as a third party to guarantee that the transaction goes through with neither side having to put themselves at risk. The escrow process can be done completely online. The most famous of these services is likely [escrow.com](http://escrow.com/). It is a US-based service which has been operating since 1999, protecting transactions with total worth of billions of dollars. 

From the buyer point of view the domain transaction using an escrow service is quite painless. When you are on the buying side, first you will receive an email saying that a transaction is waiting for you. You then set up an escrow.com account if you have not yet created one. Then you wire the payment to escrow. They will hold the payment until you have confirmed that the domain was transferred to you and only then is the money released to the domain seller.

### Grabbing an expiring name

Domain names are reserved for a limited period of time. What if someone no longer wants their name lets it expire? At first it enters a grace period for 30-90 days, during which the original owner can still renew the domain. After that it enters the redemption period, during which the original owner can still renew the domain, but there is a fee involved. If even after the redemption period is over the original owner has still not renewed, then it "drops" (becomes available). 

You might think that if you see a domain registration expire, you could just wait until the redemption period is over and register it yourself. However there are groups which use special software that rapidly attempt re-registration of these expired domain names over and over again in order to be the very first to re-register it. You will not be able to beat them manually. 

Luckily these companies are sort of mercenaries for hire. By paying them a small fee you can use their guns to get you the domain you want. If you want to know more about this subject, I highly recommend Mike Davidson’s classic article [How to Snatch an Expiring Domain](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/how-to-snatch-an-expiring-domain). 

The gist of it is that you can maximize your chances of getting your domain by instructing several of these “drop catching services” to attempt to get your name. I’ve had some luck using [pool.com](http://pool.com/) for this purpose, but there are many others as well. You can enter as many domains as you wish on their site, which they will then attempt to get for you. You can also browse domain names which will be expiring soon.

### Consider a brandable variation of your key term

In the beginning I wrote that all the good names are taken. That's not entirely true. Actually only all **obvious** names are taken. Your best option may be to come up with a new unique name that no-one else has thought of. Something catchy, with personality and branding potential. 

A non-generic name can have other benefits as well. If you have an animal name or an object in the name, then it instantly gives you ideas of what the mascot or logo of the club might be like. For example the Japanese anime box of the month club "[boxychan.com](http://www.boxychan.com/)" has a cute box as their mascot, which makes it a lot more memorable than if it was something generic such as "monthlyanimebox.com".

Another great example of a name with benefits is [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com/), an email marketing service provider which uses a chimp as their mascot. This might give you an idea: use your desired noun + some branding word as your name. Have your desired term in there along with an interesting prefix or suffix. You can put these ideas through [Instant Domain Search](http://instantdomainsearch.com) to try them quickly, but there is an even faster way. There are services where you can enter lists of words to try as prefixes and suffixes and it tells you which ones are available. Some even have those lists built in. 

The best one I have found is called [Lean Domain Search](http://www.leandomainsearch.com/). Suppose for example that you are thinking of starting a snack-related subscription box. As there are already dozens of snack boxes and many domain speculators out there, you will find that almost any good name is already taken. Entering the word "snack" into Lean Domain Search, you'll find that actually some good combinations of popular word beginnings or endings added to "snack" are still available! It doesn't suggest cute animal suffixes, but can find for example that "SnackGlobal.com", "SnackGate.com", "EpicSnack.com", "ViaSnack.com" and "SnackBoss.com" among many others are still out there for grabs.

I hope some of these tips helped you find a great domain name for your subscription box, or convinced you to stop obsessing about it until later!

# What goes into running a subscription box?

The biggest tasks are marketing, fulfillment, website maintenance, customer support, bookkeeping tasks, curation and investigating directions to expansion and things to optimize. 

## Fulfillment

Of these for our twice-monthly candy box Candy Japan, fulfillment was the easiest to delegate to someone else to do, as it is purely manual labor. Some effort is required to gather the list of addresses and sanity-check that the entered addresses and amounts make sense. You can either do fulfillment in-house or hire an outside third-party logistics company.

## Marketing

You can spend all your time on marketing if you wanted to. There are thousands of places where you could advertise, both paid and free. You can never get to the point where you'll feel marketing is "done", there are always more opportunities. Even just the options to tweak ad campaigns are endless. On the other hand marketing through the seemingly free social media and content-marketing channels is an endlessly time-consuming task as well. Somewhere between these paid and free channels is providing free sample boxes for bloggers, which ends up taking time just to evaluate which blogs are worth sending to and keeping in touch with them to maintain relationships.

## Customer support

Customer support gets tiresome, as you are often dealing with very similar issues. If you are using a home-grown system, you may find that the information you need to answer these question is buried somewhere in a database which only you understand, which makes outsourcing this more challenging. This is one good reason to use a ready-made subscription management system such as CrateJoy or Subbly. Besides just the usual support questions, there are always new situations occurring which can only be answered by you, meaning with a somewhat successful box you will always end up having some email to answer yourself every day.

For instance I often find myself having to dig for some information manually in our database or try to make educated guesses when a customer requests something to be done, but is emailing from a different address than the one they registered with. These examples sound bad and probably make you feel like “well, that should be easily fixable”. And they are, which is part of the support task, improving things so that those things will no longer get asked.

## Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping is required for you to be able to correctly pay taxes and have some picture of whether you are making any profit with your box. It involves mostly storing offline and online receipts and entering their information into spreadsheets. Even with a hired bookkeeper you still end up doing some of this, as when for instance you make an order for some product which will be included in the box, you will be the one who gets the receipt. 

When you sign up for an online product such as CrateJoy or ZenDesk, those receipts will get sent to your account. Each month you will need to find all these receipts and summarize them somehow for your books. Last month for out subscription box Candy Japan I had 50 receipts for various purchases and online services and just summarizing this for my bookkeeper takes several evenings to do. Mostly because it is such a dull task it is very easy to get distracted while doing it! Luckily this task at least has a well-defined end to it, but it keeps repeating each month.

We are paying a bookkeeper, but that doesn’t mean you never need to deal with the issue. You must still be able to explain each receipt and HAVE each receipt. Each time you pay for something online, you have to figure out how to get the receipt for that later. You may be using an email system, a hosting site, buy tape and envelopes online, perhaps travel somewhere and use cash to buy your tickets etc. and for all of these things you will need to have the receipts and organize them in some way. 

## The fun parts

Curation is about finding the items to put in your box. Not every item you can think of is necessarily possible to purchase by you in the desired quantities. You might have a dream box in mind, but find out that half of the items have already been discontinued and are no longer available. Some might be available only in awkward quantities, such as a box of 200 pieces when all you needed was 150. 

These limitations mean that to find a box containing 5 items, you might need to investigate more than 10 to be able to settle down to 5 which are practically possible. This can be made easier by using a catalogue of products which you know are available. Curation can be a bit tricky because of these limitations, but it is definitely one of the more fun parts of running a box.

After all of the above tasks are dealt with, comes what at least to me is the most fun part: expansion! This means discovering new marketing channels to try, optimizing your homepage for conversions, improving your box, hiring staff, including new types of inserts in your box etc. things which will change the month-to-month operation, hopefully for the better. Perhaps you could increase the variety of your subscription plans or start/acquire completely new lines of business. 

It is also quite enjoyable to think of ways to improve operations, such as eliminating some steps required for putting together your box or finding a way to otherwise not do something you were previously having to do every month. Before running a subscription box I never thought I would get so excited about reading up on different ways to do shipping labels more efficiently.

This sort of improvement is very useful for your sanity as well, as it will make you feel optimism: "ah, things can get better". But soon the next repetitive monthly tasks are around again and you go from floating on your idea cloud back to the trenches; and the cycle continues.

# Setting up your site

# Marketing

Now you have your idea and your site is set up, what now? Well, you have to tell the world about it. Whether anyone will know that your box exists really makes or breaks it. Still, this does not mean that you should blindly go out and throw money at advertising. Even if you are normally more fond of intuitive thinking rather than very strategic and logical, this is one field in which you should know a few things before jumping in. The two most important concepts are the **funnel** and **customer lifetime value (LTV)**.
