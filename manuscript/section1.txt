# Running your own subscription box business

Hi there! My name is Bemmu Sepponen. I'm a Finnish expat living in Japan.

I started my own subscription box [Candy Japan](http://www.candyjapan.com) back in 2011 and grew it to 1000 subscribers. Ever since starting it I committed myself to radical openness (mostly in the form of [blogging](http://www.candyjapan.com/blog)) about all the business aspects of running the box, treating it more as a "business experiment" than a project to be secretive about.

This book attempts to cover everything I have learned about running and growing a subscription box business over the years. I hope the information here will help you achieve success with your own box. OK, let's get to it :-)

PS. congratulations, it's now about 10x easier to start a new box than when I started, thanks to recently available software and more advanced payment gateways.

## What should you send?

As you probably know full well having bought this book, a subscription box is a business model where customers are automatically charged monthly and in exchange get curated boxes in the mail.

For Candy Japan I chose to go with Japanese candy, simply because I happened to be living in Japan myself and they seemed to have the best combination of light weight, coolness and variety. With endless variety customers would not easily get tired of it, and since candy is consumable it would not pile up. And who doesn't like candy?

I attempted to run other boxes too. I started a stationary box, but shut it down after a few months after realizing that I'm just not that passionate about stationary. I considered some other types of boxes as well (such as ramen), but they never even got that far as I realized I just didn't have the passion for them.

Similarly for your own box you might consider your own interests a bit. After you are making money and have a lot of subscribers it is easy to stay motivated, but to get started you will have to be willing to curate and send boxes to only a handful of customers. To survive this phase it might be helpful to choose a topic you are actually interested in.

### Four considerations for picking your items

If I were starting a new box now, what I'd be concerned about most is **how to reach customers**? Start a box for which it will be simple to reach an audience. Maybe you already have an idea for a box. Now imagine that you have started it, your site is up and accepting orders. 

Now what? Is there a Facebook group or forum where your potential customers are gathering? Is there an obvious place to advertise your box? If you are doing a box for fans of Sherlock Holmes it will be much easier to target it than if you were doing a more generic box.

If you are sending a new box each month with say 4 items in it, is there enough variety with your chosen topic that you will be able to find 48 new products each year? With Japanese candy this was not a problem, as new types of candy are coming out each month.

Are the items practical to send? Depending on where you send from, the cost of postage is usually determined by weight (although Google "cubic pricing" for the exception to this). Can you make money even in the beginning when you might not be able to buy them at cheaper than retail price?

If you choose items with no expiration date, you will have more flexibility in preparing for future orders. For candy we end up disposing a lot of it just because we could not order the specific amount we needed, it expired and can no longer be used.
