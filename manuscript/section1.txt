# Why start a monthly subscription box?

Hi, how's it going? Thank you for buying this book. As you probably know full well, a monthly subscription box is a business model where customers receive curated assortments of items in the mail periodically in exchange for an automatically recurring payment. Like a magazine subscription.

We started our subscription box [Candy Japan](http://www.candyjapan.com) back in 2011 and it has since reached 1000 paying subscribers. Our concept is sending random assortments of Japanese candies to subscribers twice each month. I decided to treat the service more as a "business experiment" where I would [blog](http://www.candyjapan.com/blog)) about all aspects of running the box, skipping the usual secrecy.

This book attempts to cover everything I have learned about running and growing a subscription box business over the years. In addition I have researched some completely new topics that I thought would be useful to include for you in starting your own box. I hope the information here will help you achieve success.

## Advantages of the subscription model

### It's fun for the customers

Most people enjoy surprise gifts. A subscription box is not only a fun gift for someone else, but can be a way to "surprise your future self" by placing an order, forgetting about it for a while and later on be delighted when an unexpected box with a variety of goodies inside arrives. It's like Christmas every month. 

It can be a good shopping experience for trying a variety of goods without needing to consciously make product selections. When presented with too many choices, [some customers may be overwhelmed and end up purchasing less](http://www.ted.com/talks/sheena_iyengar_on_the_art_of_choosing?language=en). 

A subscription box can provide a sense of community not present in with a traditional e-commerce store. While in an online store customers are isolated when completing their own personal purchases, subscription commerce is more like a club when many people are receiving the same boxes. Discussion and social media sharing over the box and its contents can take place.

### Affordable to get started for the entrepreneur

Unlike starting a restaurant franchise or other business where you have to make large investments from the get-go before you even know if you will have any customers, for a subscription box you get to send out the product AFTER you already know you can sell it. 

Besides voluntary costs such as site design, there really aren't any big initial investments to make for a subscription box. Even commissioning fancy custom boxes you can put off until after you have built a customer base to justify placing larger orders for packaging materials.

### Higher customer value than traditional e-commerce

Unlike an online shop focusing on one-time sales, a subscription box is attractive because customers agree to pay again and again for each box. Customers’ credit cards are charged automatically unless they explicitly terminate their subscription. This is the opposite way compared to typical e-commerce, where no further purchase is assumed unless the customer returns to the website to make another purchase. In a subscription box the default is multiple sales, with the immediate ending of the relationship a sad less likely occurrence.

This doesn’t mean that each customer is infinitely valuable as people do eventually cancel. At the end of the day a new subscriber for a subscription box is still a “conversion” with a somewhat known value to it, so in that sense it does not differ from a one-off ecommerce site. However it can mean that one customer is MORE valuable for a subscription box company. That means that if you are advertising using Google ads for instance, a subscription box can afford to outbid the traditional online retailer, as each customer has a higher lifetime value (LTV).

### Easier to predict needed inventory

While the amount of subscribers you have will change month-to-month, you can predict how many items you will be needing. If you send the same product to everyone on the same schedule, it gets easier still, as you can even know which items to prepare. Compare this to a normal ecommerce business where you are holding small amounts of a large variety of goods. 

You can even arrange things so that if you have items left over from the previous month, you can send it to future new subscribers as their first box. If you do this, you can reach 100% usage of your inventory. This is fantastic, as with traditional online shops it is not untypical to never be able to sell some items which just end up in storage forever or get disposed of.

As the founder of [Carnivore Club](https://www.carnivoreclub.co) said in a [Financial Post interview](http://business.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/need-recurring-revenue-think-subscription-boxes), *"From a business perspective, it’s the most efficient, flexible and easy to operate business model in ecommerce"*.

### Example box: Panty by Post

Need a jolt more inspiration for starting your own box? Here is Natalie Grunberg on how her monthly lingerie club [PantybyPost.com](http://www.pantybypost.com) got started.

> I run the successful subscription commerce enterprise [PantybyPost.com](http://www.pantybypost.com). We ship a pretty French panty every month in the mail worldwide. We have partners in Paris and an office in Moscow. How do we do it? I will reveal a few of my secrets but please keep in mind, there is no recipe to success other than a good idea mixed with stubborn, unforgiving hard work. If you are prepared to take your idea and mix it with your blood and sweat, then you may have a chance at shipping thousands of your own products all over the world too. 
>
> I started the company over three years ago, inspired by my frequent visits to France. The idea came together while I was sitting at a corner cafe admiring the French ladies and their fashion. My challenge to myself became, how do I ship a little bit of what these stylish women have all over the world. Panty by Post took shape when I returned to Canada. It started with a latte in Paris and has become a growing corporation in Canada. 
>
> My education is in advertising, marketing and teaching. I have learned my business by connecting with established business people and professionals. I have learned on the job and listened to my own innate business development skills and talents to drive the company to where it is today. The business now includes other valuable staff and we are growing.
>
> There has been a move from "bricks to click" and the power of the Internet to reach a world market is undeniable. Running an Internet business does not mean a sure thing but it does offer the kind of flexibility many creative thinkers need to flourish. If 9-5 is not your idea schedule, running an Internet business is appealing. That being said, you may end up working 9-midnight but at least you're loving it!
>
> My marketing and customer acquisition plan began locally. I started by meeting people of influence I knew in Vancouver. They offered sage advice and sometimes contacts of their own. I had a coach and together for three months she helped me create a dynamite pitch list and then off I went contacting the media in my town and then beyond. Now we have PR staff in Paris and Moscow, with more partnerships in the works!
>
> After we gained traction in the market we upgraded our site and refreshed our branding. We applied our knowledge of our market and focussed our offerings and branding to serve customers better. Our top sales periods are of course Valentine's and Christmas, but we have steady sales at all times because people always need a treat or have an occasion to buy gifts. We have been running this business during a recession but our kind of luxury is affordable and accessible. 
>
> We have a renew and refer program, so our customer retention is high. We work very hard to make sure our customers are 100% satisfied. Our business is based on referrals, so we work excessively hard to value each client. We do CPC (cost per click) ads with google but this takes a long time to tweak to get good results. We enlist the help of bloggers to do reviews and we've been fortunate to be picked up my People and Style Magazines. 
>
> Our new plans for growing the business are to expand our social media reach. We love our Pinterest board and we have a new writer on staff to help us with our blog. We are always looking for good international relationships and we're currently in talks with business people in Turkey and Brazil. Who knows, we could be creating our own lingerie line next (wink)?


## What should you send?

### It helps to choose items you are personally interested in

I have attempted to run other boxes besides Candy Japan too. I started a stationery box, but shut it down after a few months upon realizing that I'm just not that passionate about clever pens, pencils, paper, and envelopes.

Similarly for your own box you might consider your own interests a bit. If you are starting from nothing by yourself with no existing customer base or budget for a huge marketing campaign, in the first months you will have to be willing to curate and send boxes to only a handful of customers. 

Can you stay motivated? To survive this phase it might be helpful to choose a topic you are actually interested in. If your box business starts growing rapidly then the booming revenues will probably be motivation enough, but there may be times when your number of customers stays flat and you still somehow have to keep going. 

### Choose a topic for which customers are easy to reach

You'll have a much easier time if you start a box for which it will be simple to reach an audience. Maybe you already have an idea for a box. Now imagine for a moment that you have already started it, your site is up and accepting orders. It exists, all your starter tasks are finished. 

Now what? How will you reach potential customers?

Is there a place where they are gathering, such as a Facebook group or a discussion forum? Is there an obvious place to advertise your box? If your box is for fans of Sherlock Holmes it will be much easier to target it by reaching out to the owners of related websites or groups. It'll be much tougher if your box is something so generic that there aren't really groups fanatical about your idea.

### Make sure there is a large variety of products available

If you are sending a new box each month with say 4 items in it, is there enough variety that you will be able to find 48 new products each year? You may not be able to buy wholesale quantities of just any product. 

When curating new candies to include in our box, we usually have to look into twice as many products as we end up sending, as many are not available for a variety of reasons. Some are no longer manufactured, some limited to certain regions only, some have a special deal with certain stores and cannot be bought directly, or are only manufactured once a year and need to be pre-ordered months in advance.

For Candy Japan I chose to go with Japanese candy, simply because I happened to be living in Japan myself and candy is a good combination of light weight, fun and endless variety. As new candy is coming out every month, customers would not easily get tired of it. Since candy is consumable it would not pile up. And who doesn't like candy?

Having a large selection of different manufacturers will also help you buy the items at better discounts, as you will have more buying choices. Even if one provider does not want to work with you, there are others you can ask. Still in the beginning it may be smart to build in enough margin that you can get started profitably, even if you are unable to get any discount over the retail price at all.

### Easy to ship?

Almost anything can be shipped, but some will be more economical than others. Antarctican ice cube of the month club might seem like a good idea, until you look up the shipping cost of a refridgerated heavy shipment from the South Pole.

Are the items affordable to send? Depending on where you send from, the cost of postage is usually determined by weight, although within the United States you can also opt for "cubic pricing" where pricing is based on distance and volume instead. 

If you choose items with no expiration date, you will have more flexibility in preparing for future orders. For candy we end up throwing a lot of it out just because we cannot always order the specific amount needed. If you can go with something non-perishable, you can use them later in the first boxes sent to new members.

Some items can be more difficult to send without damage. For instance chocolate can melt on the way if sent during hot months.
