# What's it like running a subscription box?

We started our subscription box [Candy Japan](http://www.candyjapan.com) back in 2011 and it has since reached 1000 paying subscribers. I decided to treat it more as a "business experiment" where I would [blog](http://www.candyjapan.com/blog)) about all aspects of running the box, skipping the usual secrecy.

As you probably know full well having bought this book, a subscription box is a business model where customers are automatically charged monthly and in exchange receive curated assortments of items in the mail.

This book attempts cover everything I have learned about running and growing a subscription box business over the years. In addition I have researched some completely new topics that I thought would be useful for you in starting your own box. I hope the information here will help you achieve success.

## What should you send?

### It helps to choose items you are personally interested in

I have attempted to run other boxes besides Candy Japan too. I started a stationery box, but shut it down after a few months upon realizing that I'm just not that passionate about clever pens, pencils, paper, and envelopes.

Similarly for your own box you might consider your own interests a bit. If you are starting from nothing by yourself with no existing customer base or budget for a huge marketing campaign, in the first months you will have to be willing to curate and send boxes to only a handful of customers. 

Can you stay motivated? To survive this phase it might be helpful to choose a topic you are actually interested in. If your box business starts growing rapidly then the booming revenues will probably be motivation enough, but there may be times when your number of customers stays flat and you still somehow have to keep going. 

### Choose a topic for which customers are easy to reach

You'll have a much easier time if you start a box for which it will be simple to reach an audience. Maybe you already have an idea for a box. Now imagine for a moment that you have already started it, your site is up and accepting orders. It exists, all your starter tasks are finished. 

Now what? How will you reach potential customers?

Is there a place where they are gathering, such as a Facebook group or a discussion forum? Is there an obvious place to advertise your box? If your box is for fans of Sherlock Holmes it will be much easier to target it by reaching out to the owners of related websites or groups. It'll be much tougher if your box is something so generic that there aren't really groups fanatical about your idea.

### Make sure there is a large variety of products available

If you are sending a new box each month with say 4 items in it, is there enough variety that you will be able to find 48 new products each year? You may not be able to buy wholesale quantities of just any product. 

When curating new candies to include in our box, we usually have to look into twice as many products as we end up sending, as many are not available for a variety of reasons. Some are no longer manufactured, some limited to certain regions only, some have a special deal with certain stores and cannot be bought directly, or are only manufactured once a year and need to be pre-ordered months in advance.

For Candy Japan I chose to go with Japanese candy, simply because I happened to be living in Japan myself and candy is a good combination of light weight, fun and endless variety. As new candy is coming out every month, customers would not easily get tired of it. Since candy is consumable it would not pile up. And who doesn't like candy?

Having a large selection of different manufacturers will also help you buy the items at better discounts, as you will have more buying choices. Even if one provider does not want to work with you, there are others you can ask. Still in the beginning it may be smart to build in enough margin that you can get started profitably, even if you are unable to get any discount over the retail price at all.

### Easy to ship?

Almost anything can be shipped, but some will be more economical than others. Antarctican ice cube of the month club might seem like a good idea, until you look up the shipping cost of a refridgerated heavy shipment from the South Pole.

Are the items affordable to send? Depending on where you send from, the cost of postage is usually determined by weight, although within the United States you can also opt for "cubic pricing" where pricing is based on distance and volume instead. 

If you choose items with no expiration date, you will have more flexibility in preparing for future orders. For candy we end up throwing a lot of it out just because we cannot always order the specific amount needed. If you can go with something non-perishable, you can use them later in the first boxes sent to new members.

Some items can be more difficult to send without damage. For instance chocolate can melt on the way if sent during hot months.
