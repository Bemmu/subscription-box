# Why start a monthly subscription box?

As you probably know full well having bought this book, a subscription box retail service is a business model where customers pay a monthly fee to receive a box of products delivered to them on a recurring basis. The product could be anything from makeup, snacks to clothing.

We started our subscription box [Candy Japan](http://www.candyjapan.com) back in 2011 and it has since reached 1000 paying subscribers. Our concept is to send curated assortments of Japanese candies to subscribers twice a month.

I decided to treat the candy service more as a "business experiment" where I would [blog](http://www.candyjapan.com/blog)) about all aspects of running the box, skipping the usual secrecy.

This book attempts expand upon that, covering everything I have learned about running and growing a subscription box business over the years. In addition I have researched some completely new topics that I thought would be useful to include for you in starting your own box.

If there is anything I can help you with, feel free to contact me@bemmu.com. I would love to hear about how you are getting your subscription business off the ground.

I hope the information here will help you achieve success. 

## Advantages of the subscription model

### It's fun for the customers

Most people enjoy surprise gifts. A subscription box is not only a fun gift for someone else, but can be a way to "surprise your future self" by placing an order, forgetting about it for a while and later on be delighted when an unexpected box with a variety of goodies inside arrives. It's like Christmas every month. 

It can be a good shopping experience for trying a variety of goods without needing to consciously make product selections. When presented with too many choices, [some customers may be overwhelmed and end up purchasing less](http://www.ted.com/talks/sheena_iyengar_on_the_art_of_choosing?language=en). Subscription boxes combat this by curating the selection for the customer.

Additionally a subscription box can provide a sense of community not present in with a traditional e-commerce store. While in an online store customers are isolated when completing their own personal purchases, subscription commerce is more like a club when many people are receiving the same boxes. Discussion and social media sharing over the box and its contents can take place.

### Low start-up costs

Unlike starting a restaurant franchise or other business where you have to make large investments from the get-go before you even know if you will have any customers, for a subscription box you get to send out the product AFTER you already know you can sell it.

Besides voluntary costs such as site design, there really aren't any big initial investments to make for a subscription box. Even commissioning fancy custom boxes you can put off until after you have built a customer base to justify placing larger orders for packaging materials.

If you have any existing audience, you don't even necessarily have to set up a website. You can handle your first subscriptions manually and collect payments through PayPal email subscription links, even with no fancy membership system in place. This way you can skip even the initial web set-up costs such as ecommerce system fees, logos, illustrations and so on. For Candy Japan it all started with just an email to a few existing customers to see if they would also be interested in receiving candy monthly.

### Higher customer value than traditional e-commerce

Unlike an online shop focusing on one-time sales, a subscription box is attractive because customers agree to pay again and again for each box. Customers’ credit cards are charged automatically unless they explicitly terminate their subscription. This is the opposite way compared to typical e-commerce, where no further purchase is assumed unless the customer explicitly returns to the website to shop more. 

This doesn’t mean that each customer is infinitely valuable as people do eventually cancel. Still in a monthly box the default is multiple sales, with the immediate ending of the subscription a less likely occurrence. Your best customers can stay on for years. Many who subscribed to our box 4 years ago are still continuing each month even today.

At the end of the day a new subscriber for a subscription box is still a “conversion” with a somewhat known value to it, so in that sense it does not differ from a one-off ecommerce site. However it can mean that one customer is MORE valuable for a subscription box company. That means that if you are advertising using Google ads for instance, a subscription box can afford to outbid the traditional online retailer, as each customer has a higher lifetime value (LTV).

### Easier to predict needed inventory

While the amount of subscribers you have will change month-to-month, you can predict how many items you will be needing. If you send the same product to everyone on the same schedule, it gets easier still, as you can even know which items to prepare. Compare this to a normal ecommerce business where you are holding small amounts of a large variety of goods. 

You can even arrange things so that if you have items left over from the previous month, you can send it to future new subscribers as their first box. If you do this, you can reach 100% usage of your inventory. This is fantastic, as with traditional online shops it is not untypical to never be able to sell some items which just end up in storage forever or get disposed of.

As the founder of [Carnivore Club](https://www.carnivoreclub.co) said in a [Financial Post interview](http://business.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/need-recurring-revenue-think-subscription-boxes), *"From a business perspective, it’s the most efficient, flexible and easy to operate business model in ecommerce"*.

### Another example box: Panty by Post

Need a jolt more inspiration for starting your own box? Here is Natalie Grunberg on how her monthly lingerie club [PantybyPost.com](http://www.pantybypost.com) got started.

> I run the successful subscription commerce enterprise [PantybyPost.com](http://www.pantybypost.com). We ship a pretty French panty every month in the mail worldwide. We have partners in Paris and an office in Moscow. How do we do it? I will reveal a few of my secrets but please keep in mind, there is no recipe to success other than a good idea mixed with stubborn, unforgiving hard work. If you are prepared to take your idea and mix it with your blood and sweat, then you may have a chance at shipping thousands of your own products all over the world too. 
>
> I started the company over three years ago, inspired by my frequent visits to France. The idea came together while I was sitting at a corner cafe admiring the French ladies and their fashion. My challenge to myself became, how do I ship a little bit of what these stylish women have all over the world. Panty by Post took shape when I returned to Canada. It started with a latte in Paris and has become a growing corporation in Canada. 
>
> My education is in advertising, marketing and teaching. I have learned my business by connecting with established business people and professionals. I have learned on the job and listened to my own innate business development skills and talents to drive the company to where it is today. The business now includes other valuable staff and we are growing.
>
> There has been a move from "bricks to click" and the power of the Internet to reach a world market is undeniable. Running an Internet business does not mean a sure thing but it does offer the kind of flexibility many creative thinkers need to flourish. If 9-5 is not your idea schedule, running an Internet business is appealing. That being said, you may end up working 9-midnight but at least you're loving it!
>
> My marketing and customer acquisition plan began locally. I started by meeting people of influence I knew in Vancouver. They offered sage advice and sometimes contacts of their own. I had a coach and together for three months she helped me create a dynamite pitch list and then off I went contacting the media in my town and then beyond. Now we have PR staff in Paris and Moscow, with more partnerships in the works!
>
> After we gained traction in the market we upgraded our site and refreshed our branding. We applied our knowledge of our market and focussed our offerings and branding to serve customers better. Our top sales periods are of course Valentine's and Christmas, but we have steady sales at all times because people always need a treat or have an occasion to buy gifts. We have been running this business during a recession but our kind of luxury is affordable and accessible. 
>
> We have a renew and refer program, so our customer retention is high. We work very hard to make sure our customers are 100% satisfied. Our business is based on referrals, so we work excessively hard to value each client. We do CPC (cost per click) ads with google but this takes a long time to tweak to get good results. We enlist the help of bloggers to do reviews and we've been fortunate to be picked up my People and Style Magazines. 
>
> Our new plans for growing the business are to expand our social media reach. We love our Pinterest board and we have a new writer on staff to help us with our blog. We are always looking for good international relationships and we're currently in talks with business people in Turkey and Brazil. Who knows, we could be creating our own lingerie line next (wink)?


## How much money can you make?

The range is huge. Anything between bundles of money lost, building a nice lifestyle business all the way up to multimillion dollar exits.

The jackpot is making millions when your box really takes off, riding off to the sunset on your own unicorn. Three example startups that have found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow are Birchbox, Ipsy and Joliebox. All of these are in the beauty space.

The beauty sampling box [Birchbox](http://www.birchbox.com), [has been valued at over $500 million and sports 1 million monthly paying members](http://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/business/2015/09/29/73016704/). Make-up box [Ipsy has 1.5 million subscribers each paying $10/month](http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/14/makeup-subscription-delivery-service-ipsy-raises-100m/#.ifvogw:deQE) for its monthly "glam bags". Joliebox was similar to Birchbox except being based in Europe, [until Birchbox outright bought them](http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/13/birchbox-goes-global-acquires-paris-based-copycat-joliebox/). While the purchase price isn't public, it is likely a nice multiple of the $12 million that was invested in the company.

For many successful boxes a large part of their sales comes from selling individual items in a more traditional online store, with the subscription box acting as a way to introduce members to these new items. [For the South Korean beauty box Memebox, over 70 percent of revenue comes from straight-up online retail. The company makes US$1.3 million in sales a month](https://www.techinasia.com/beauty-boxes-great-ecommerce-fad-asia-unraveled/).

There are bound to be many horror stories as well.

Want to find some more real-life examples? Here are some additional ways to get insight into how much money other subscription boxes are making.

### Find oversharers

Our box Candy Japan currently has about 1000 subscribers. The monthly subscription cost is $25.00, of which roughly $5 is left after all the expenses as profit, meaning. When everything goes smoothly (often it does not) I can receive an income of around $5000/month from running this box. Most box companies keep these sales numbers secret, for good reasons. Being too vocal could cause trouble, as it can make you a target for scams and can be seen as distasteful / arrogant. If your numbers are even a bit attractive, it can inspire competition. While in practice this has not been a huge problem for us, these are good valid reasons that most businesses keep silent.

Some boxes such as our box [Candy Japan](http://www.candyjapan.com/blog) and Rohan Gilkes' box [Wet Shave Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2h1mlt/the_inner_workings_of_a_subscription_box_company/) share their numbers likely partly because it acts as a form of marketing in itself. In my case the other reason is that I like to help and have a hopeless tendency to overshare!

Another example is the beef jerky box [SumoJerky](http://www.sumojerky.com/). [In a Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3mdcwj/for_anyone_who_wants_to_see_the_inner_numbers/) the founder shared that their yearly sales were $159,000 and profit was $35,000. 

You can find even more examples of such income report sharing from the non-box world, such as ebook author [Sacha Greif revealing his sales numbers](http://bloggerjet.com/sacha-greif-on-earning-15000-from-selling-his-ebook/) or [KreCi with his Android app sales reports](http://www.kreci.net/reports/developer-income-report-8/).

### Find box businesses for sale

Sometimes you can get a glimpse at revenue numbers by finding sites which the owner is attempting to sell. You can find such sites on auction sites such as Flippa. 

You can get a lot of ideas about what kind of revenues different sites have by browsing Flippa's "established sites" and filtering to only those which have posted verified Google Analytics screenshots. 

Besides getting a peek at their financials, you might even find buying such a box a good starting point for your own business. If you have some money to invest, you could continue from an established subscriber base instead of starting from scratch.

![Paleo Life Box sold on Flippa for $13,000](images/flippa_paleo.png)

The sites for sale on Flippa are mostly not subscription boxes, but occassionally you can find some box companies as well. For instance the snack box [PaleoLifeBox.com](https://flippa.com/5545303-snack-of-the-month-subscription-box-club-hitting-5k-mrr-consistent-growth) has been on sale on Flippa and reported revenues of ~$4000/month. Another one for sale was an anime goods box [FaniPack](http://flippingethics.com/2015/05-16/fanipack-com-being-sold-by-jvan6-on-flippa.html) (which I bought) with reported revenues of $2500/month.

If you are truly interested in purchasing an existing box business, you don't necessarily have to limit your search to only those listed on online auction sites. If there is a box you feel is within your budget to acquire, you can email the owner directly to express your interest. However if you have no real intention of buying the site in question, you should not be rude and pretend to be interested just to spy on their sales numbers. It is rather disrespectful of peoples' time and unethical (it can work though, as I have been on the receiving end of such requests and did share my stats).

Once you own a successful box business yourself, the sales sites may come in useful if you decide to sell it. In that case you may find that the prices on Flippa are not very attractive from the seller point of view. Publicly selling your business with full information published for anyone to see can also be detrimental. It can help your competition or inspire completely new players to start copycat businesses. For these reasons as a seller it can be better to have a more closed sales process, selling directly to an interested party or using a more discreet sales site such as [Empire Flippers](https://empireflippers.com) where a [deposit is required to see the sales details](https://empireflippers.com/see-the-url/).

### Look at search stats 

Here's a small trick to roughly see how popular an established box is. This will only work for businesses that have thousands of new subscribers each month.

The idea is that to save some money, many customers search for box discount coupons before making a subscribing. Therefore if you could know how many such coupon searches are taking place, you could very roughly estimate how many new subscribers are joining each month. Turns out you can, using the Google AdWords online advertising program's feature called [Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/keywordplanner).

![Monthly searches for BirchBox promo code](images/birchbox_promo_code.png)

As an example take BirchBox, the very popular beauty product sampling box. In the screenshot above you can see that around 50,000 people each month are searching for their coupons. Actually the term "promo code" seems to be the most common one, although "discount code" also makes an appearance. 

That means that as a lower bound, they are getting at least 50,000 new subscribers each month. The reality is probably even better for them, a large multiple of that. Not everyone will search for a promo code before subscribing, making the search numbers lower than reality. 

Again, this is just a quick hack to see a rough number and by no means a surefire method. It still serves an interesting signal that a box may be onto something if the business is otherwise flying under the radar but has impressive numbers showing up in the keyword tool.

## What should you send?

### Choose items you are personally interested in

I have attempted to run other boxes besides Candy Japan too. I started a stationery box, but shut it down after a few months upon realizing that I'm just not that passionate about clever pens, pencils, paper, and envelopes.

Similarly for your own box you might consider your own interests a bit. If you are starting from nothing by yourself with no existing customer base or budget for a huge marketing campaign, in the first months you will have to be willing to curate and send boxes to only a handful of customers. 

Can you stay motivated? To survive this phase it might be helpful to choose a topic you are actually interested in. If your box business starts growing rapidly then the booming revenues will probably be motivation enough, but there may be times when your number of customers stays flat and you still somehow have to keep going. 

### Choose a topic for which customers are easy to reach

You'll have a much easier time if you start a box for which it will be simple to reach an audience. Maybe you already have an idea for a box. Now imagine for a moment that you have already started it, your site is up and accepting orders. It exists, all your starter tasks are finished. 

Now what? How will you reach potential customers?

Is there a place where they are gathering, such as a Facebook group or a discussion forum? Is there an obvious place to advertise your box? If your box is for fans of Sherlock Holmes it will be much easier to target it by reaching out to the owners of related websites or groups. It'll be much tougher if your box is something so generic that there aren't really groups fanatical about your idea.

### Make sure there is a large variety of products available

If you are sending a new box each month with say 4 items in it, is there enough variety that you will be able to find 48 new products each year? You may have to research even more products than this, as you may not be able to buy your required quantities of just any product, or at least not at a reasonable price.

For Candy Japan I chose to go with Japanese candy, simply because I happened to be living in Japan myself and candy is a good combination of light weight, fun and endless variety. As new candy is coming out every month, customers would not easily get tired of it. Since candy is consumable it would not pile up. And who doesn't like candy?

When curating new candies to include in our box, we usually have to look into twice as many products as we end up sending, as many are not available for a variety of reasons. Some are no longer manufactured, some limited to certain regions only, some have a special deal with certain stores and cannot be bought directly, or are only manufactured once a year and need to be pre-ordered months in advance.

Having a large selection of different manufacturers will also help you buy the items at better discounts, as you will have more buying choices. Even if one provider does not want to work with you, there are others you can ask. Still in the beginning it may be smart to build in enough margin that you can get started profitably, even if you are unable to get any discount over the retail price at all.

### Easy to ship?

Almost anything can be shipped, but some items will be more economical to send than others. Antarctican ice cube of the month club might seem like a good idea, until you look up the shipping cost of a refridgerated heavy shipment from the South Pole. Depending on where you send from, the cost of postage is usually determined by weight, although within the United States you can also opt for "cubic pricing" where pricing is based on distance and volume instead. 

If you choose items with no expiration date, you will have more flexibility in preparing for future orders. For candy we end up throwing a lot of it out just because we cannot always order the specific amount needed. If you can go with something non-perishable, you can use them later in the first boxes sent to new members.

Some items can be more difficult to send without damage. For instance chocolate can melt on the way if sent during hot months. 

### Choosing what items to send isn't everything

While choosing the right type of items to send is important, it's not by any means the only factor determining the success of your box. To give an example I really recommmend reading the [story of Wet Shave Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2h1mlt/the_inner_workings_of_a_subscription_box_company/). The site was already established, but after an ownership change and a lot of rebranding it really took off. Site owner [Rohan Gilkes]() has posted [another very detailed guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/tltuy/day_26_from_zero_to_website_launcha_recap_of/) from launching his other business as well. I strongly suggest reading the guide, as most of the content applies to any online business.

As further evidence of how choosing the right items isn't everything, our box [Candy Japan](http://www.candyjapan.com) is not the only subscription box selling Japanese candies. There are plenty of others in the space, such as [Japan Crate](http://www.japancrate.com), who despite having started their boxes much later and sending the same items, have reached higher subscriber numbers through better execution. As you can see, the type of items you choose to send does not have to be unique. Success lies more in other details.

## Buying the perfect domain name

Did you come up with an idea for what to send? You might want to continue brainstorming by checking if any good names for such a box are available. For Candy Japan we got really lucky that the most obvious name for a Japanese candy box happened to still be up for grabs.

I wouldn’t necessarily recommend spending too much time thinking of a good name to start with, because once you've done enough other work, it will be easier to come up with the name. For instance if you have spent days thinking about all the different aspects of your subscription site, planning up a prototype box, thought about what kind of customers you would attempt to attract and many other details, thinking up a good name for your box will come more naturally. 

If you go ahead and register a name first, one thing that often happens is that you may find your passion for the idea vanes, but you get stuck having the name. Every year when it comes time to renew your registration you'll feel like perhaps later on you will start using the name, so better renew your registration. Have a few more such "just in case" domains and soon you'll find yourself paying $100 / year just squatting on some unused names.

It can also be a bit of a trap to be unable to proceed just because you got stuck on thinking about the name, but if you are dead set on choosing a name first, well alright, let me give you a push and try to help you get unstuck.

### How to quickly check domain name availability

To try out different name ideas, it's useful to be able to quickly check the availability of various names.

One of my favorite tools for brainstorming domain names is called [Instant Domain Search](http://instantdomainsearch.com). It shows whether a domain is available or not in real time while you type in the name. Sometimes it does give false positives, so don’t party until double-checking the result using another tool, such as your domain registrar’s reservation page. 

If you find your favorite name was unavailable, you’re not alone with this problem. Hundreds of millions of names have already been registered. This means that pretty much any single word and many good combinations of two words are no longer up for grabs. While you might desire a short name if possible, you're unlikely to be able to register a super-short name anymore these days. Every possible combination of four letters or less is taken, unless you include special characters in the name. 

### Purchasing an existing name

Your name is taken, but does that mean you cannot have it? Not necessarily. If you have some money to spend, you can buy it from the existing owner.

If you find someone already has your name, chances are it is being held by a professional “domainer”. These are people who speculate on domain names by buying, holding and trading promising ones in the hope that later on someone like you will come along to buy it.

They may be holding massive amounts of domain names, hoping that one will end up being a hit valuable enough to cover all the costs spent on the rest. Sadly this means that they are often not very cheap. What do they cost? While many transactions happen in private, some are sold through online or real-life auction events. You can browse the prices of names that have sold in these events in the past. 

For example [dnjournal](http://www.dnjournal.com/ytd-sales-charts.htm) has such a listing, from which you can see some examples such as:

| Domain name      | Sale price      |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| HomeCare.com     | $350,000        |
| FlowerBox.com    | $55,000         |
| MegaDeal.com     | $50,000         |
| Moon.co          | £6,000          |

Another place for browsing listings is [Flippa](https://flippa.com/domains/just-sold), which had trades such as:

| Domain name      | Sale price      |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Mini-Series.com  | $6              |
| TakeSail.com     | $100            |
| Swore.com        | $2,300          |
| Cloud.io         | $45,000         |

As you can see the range of prices is huge. 

There really is no one answer to the question "what should this domain name cost"? If you happen to have two wealthy or venture-backed bidders competing against each other to secure a name, then the price is as high as those bidders can afford to go. 

### Domain name price negotiation

Besides bidding on auctions, you can also try contacting the current domain owners directly. The problem here is that it is difficult to start negotiating on the price at all if you start off with too low an offer, failing to grab their attention. This is because the owner of your desired name may prefer to avoid spending time making smaller trades when they could be concentrating on the bigger wins. They may not even bother to reply if you don’t make a sufficiently interesting offer right off the bat. Another route is to be a bit more mysterious and simply ask "is this domain for sale?" without mentioning a price.

If you do manage to get them interested, the game begins. If they are experienced domainers, they will likely try to play some psychological games with you to make you pay more. One of these is to make you believe that they are currently engaged in multiple bids for the name and that you need to outbid your competition. Whether this is true or just a trick you have no way of knowing, so you may be tempted to increase your price to outbid these possibly imaginary competitors. 

Another mental trick they might use is to claim that they acquired the name for use in a project which they currently have underway. The release of their amazing site is just right around the corner and they would be unwilling to sell the name  -- except of course they might reconsider for a considerably higher price to justify scrapping their current plans. The last time this happened to me and I walked away, the current owner still after years has not used their name for anything.

Counter-tactics to these also exist, which is why you might want to consider hiring a domain broker to buy the name for you. They can navigate these negotiations in a more cool manner since they are more detached from the name than you are and get a better price.

There are many more tricks involved in domain price negotiation, I recommend reading the blog post [How to Buy Domain Names Like a Pro](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/02/27/how-to-buy-domain-names-like-a-pro-10-tips-from-the-founder-of-phonetagcom/). Two great tips in that post are using historical whois services to help find the current domain owner and avoiding giving out any personal information in case that might serve as a justification to quote a higher price to you.

*Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.* -John F. Kennedy

### Transferring a domain name from the previous owner

If you manage to get the domain seller's attention and negotiate a sale, the transfer process itself is not difficult. When you buy an existing name, the act of transferring the domain is called a “push”. The owner of the current domain needs to log in for their registrar and then request a push through the web interface. 

You may need to send the current owner of the domain a special "authorization code" in order for them to do the push. You can find this authorization code in the web interface of your registrar. If you have your registrar set up to allow all incoming domains, then the push auth code may not be necessary.

### Securing the domain transfer with an escrow service

How do you guarantee that you won’t get scammed in the process of transferring the name? If you send the money first before receiving the domain, the seller might decide to just forget to transfer the domain to you. On the other hand if you are the one requesting the sale, then it is very unlikely that the seller would agree to transfer the domain to a stranger before receiving payment. Stalemate?

Escrow services exist to smooth out situations like these. Such a service acts as a third party to guarantee that the transaction goes through with neither side having to put themselves at risk. The escrow process can be done completely online. The most famous of these services is likely [escrow.com](http://escrow.com/). It is a US-based service which has been operating since 1999, protecting transactions with total worth of billions of dollars. 

From the buyer point of view the domain transaction using an escrow service is quite painless. When you are on the buying side, first you will receive an email saying that a transaction is waiting for you. You then set up an escrow.com account if you have not yet created one. Then you wire the payment to escrow. They will hold the payment until you have confirmed that the domain was transferred to you and only then is the money released to the domain seller.

### Grabbing an expiring name

Domain names are reserved for a limited period of time. What if someone no longer wants their name lets it expire? At first it enters a grace period for 30-90 days, during which the original owner can still renew the domain. After that it enters the redemption period, during which the original owner can still renew the domain, but there is a fee involved. If even after the redemption period is over the original owner has still not renewed, then it "drops" (becomes available). 

You might think that if you see a domain registration expire, you could just wait until the redemption period is over and register it yourself. However there are groups which use special software that rapidly attempt re-registration of these expired domain names over and over again in order to be the very first to re-register it. You will not be able to beat them manually. 

Luckily these companies are sort of mercenaries for hire. By paying them a small fee you can use their guns to get you the domain you want. If you want to know more about this subject, I highly recommend Mike Davidson’s classic article [How to Snatch an Expiring Domain](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/how-to-snatch-an-expiring-domain). 

The gist of it is that you can maximize your chances of getting your domain by instructing several of these “drop catching services” to attempt to get your name. I’ve had some luck using [pool.com](http://pool.com/) for this purpose, but there are many others as well. You can enter as many domains as you wish on their site, which they will then attempt to get for you. You can also browse domain names which will be expiring soon.

### Consider a brandable variation of your key term

In the beginning I wrote that all the good names are taken. That's not entirely true. Actually only all **obvious** names are taken. Your best option may be to come up with a new unique name that no-one else has thought of. Something catchy, with personality and branding potential. 

A non-generic name can have other benefits as well. If you have an animal name or an object in the name, then it instantly gives you ideas of what the mascot or logo of the club might be like. For example the Japanese anime box of the month club "[boxychan.com](http://www.boxychan.com/)" has a cute box as their mascot, which makes it a lot more memorable than if it was something generic such as "monthlyanimebox.com".

Another great example of a name with benefits is [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com/), an email marketing service provider which uses a chimp as their mascot. This might give you an idea: use your desired noun + some branding word as your name. Have your desired term in there along with an interesting prefix or suffix. You can put these ideas through [Instant Domain Search](http://instantdomainsearch.com) to try them quickly, but there is an even faster way. There are services where you can enter lists of words to try as prefixes and suffixes and it tells you which ones are available. Some even have those lists built in. 

The best one I have found is called [Lean Domain Search](http://www.leandomainsearch.com/). Suppose for example that you are thinking of starting a snack-related subscription box. As there are already dozens of snack boxes and many domain speculators out there, you will find that almost any good name is already taken. Entering the word "snack" into Lean Domain Search, you'll find that actually some good combinations of popular word beginnings or endings added to "snack" are still available! It doesn't suggest cute animal suffixes, but can find for example that "SnackGlobal.com", "SnackGate.com", "EpicSnack.com", "ViaSnack.com" and "SnackBoss.com" among many others are still out there for grabs.

I hope some of these tips helped you find a great domain name for your subscription box, or convinced you to stop obsessing about it until later! It's perfectly fine to keep going despite not yet deciding on a domain name for your subscription box yet, maybe even better as it can be a bit of a distraction to focus all your attention on the name.
