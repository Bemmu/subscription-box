# Running your own subscription box business

We started our subscription box [Candy Japan](http://www.candyjapan.com) back in 2011 and it has since grown to 1000 subscribers. Ever since starting it I committed myself to radical openness (mostly in the form of [blogging](http://www.candyjapan.com/blog)) about all the business aspects of running the box, treating it more as a "business experiment" than a business to be secretive about.

This book attempts to cover everything I have learned about running and growing a subscription box business over the years. I hope the information here will help you achieve success with your own box.

## What should you send?

As you probably know full well having bought this book, a subscription box is a business model where customers are automatically charged monthly and in exchange get boxes containing curated assortments of items in the mail.

I have attempted to run other boxes besides Candy Japan too. I started a stationery box, but shut it down after a few months upon realizing that I'm just not that passionate about clever pens, pencils, paper, and envelopes.

Similarly for your own box you might consider your own interests a bit. If you are starting from nothing by yourself with no existing customer base or budget for a huge marketing campaign, in the first months you will have to be willing to curate and send boxes to only a handful of customers. 

Can you stay motivated? To survive this phase it might be helpful to choose a topic you are actually interested in. If your box business starts growing rapidly then that will probably be motivation enough, but there may be times when your number of customers stays flat and you still somehow have to keep going.

### Choose a topic for which customers are easy to reach

Start a box for which it will be simple to reach an audience. Maybe you already have an idea for a box. Now imagine for a moment that you have already started it, your site is up and accepting orders. Now what? How will you reach potential customers?

Is there a Facebook group or forum where they are gathering? Is there an obvious place to advertise your box? If you are doing a box for fans of Sherlock Holmes it will be much easier to target it than something more generic. 

### Make sure there is a large variety of products available

If you are sending a new box each month with say 4 items in it, is there enough variety that you will be able to find 48 new products each year? You may not be able to buy wholesale quantities of just any product. 

When curating new candies to include in our box, we usually have to look into twice as many products as we end up sending, as many are not available for a variety of reasons. Some are no longer manufactured, some limited to certain regions only, some have a special deal with certain stores and cannot be bought directly, or are only manufactured once a year and need to be pre-ordered months in advance.

For Candy Japan I chose to go with Japanese candy, simply because I happened to be living in Japan myself and candy is a good combination of light weight, fun and endless variety. As new candy is coming out every month, customers would not easily get tired of it. Since candy is consumable it would not pile up. And who doesn't like candy?

### Easy to ship?

Are the items practical to send? Depending on where you send from, the cost of postage is usually determined by weight (although Google "cubic pricing" for the exception to this). Can you make money even in the beginning when you might not be able to buy them at cheaper than retail price and don't have enough volume for any shipping discounts?

If you choose items with no expiration date, you will have more flexibility in preparing for future orders. For candy we end up throwing a lot of it out just because we cannot always order the specific amount needed. If you can go with something non-perishable, you can use them later in the first boxes sent to new members.
