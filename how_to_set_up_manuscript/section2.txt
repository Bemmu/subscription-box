# Setting up your website

If you are sending monthly boxes in a similar way to most other subscription box companies, there is no longer any reason to build your own custom subscription system. I strongly recommend using one of the many existing subscription e-commerce platforms if at all possible. 

For our box Candy Japan we did build our own system from scratch, because at the time there were no good options. Had I been able to use a ready-made system, months of fiddling with Python, Google App Engine, PayPal API, Recurly and WireCard could have been saved. Thankfully you will no longer need to know about any of that. Don't build your own if you can avoid it! 

Actually, in the beginning you might not even need any fancy system at all.

Even a simple sign-up page can do before you have your real site together.

## Starting with a launch page

You have your domain name ready to go and are full of enthusiasm to get a site up quickly. Yet you are not feeling quite ready to figure out an ecommerce system. What would be an easy next step instead? 

One simple way to get started is to just put up a launch page. The purpose of a launch page is to simply announce that you are now working on this idea and to provide a form where interested visitors can enter their email addresses to be notified when you are ready to launch your actual site.

With a "coming soon" launch page, people can express their interest for your subscription box even before you have everything else set up, enabling you to start gathering an audience as early as possible. Google might also favor older sites slightly more when ranking search results, so having your site up earlier might not hurt there either (although it probably won't make a huge difference). 

### How to set up your LaunchRock page

There are many ways to put up a simple launch page. One option is a service called LaunchRock, which enables you to set up your launch pages easily, so you can start gathering your audience as early as possible.  

![LaunchRock landing page](images/launchrock.png)

If you already have a webhost and basic HTML skills, it might be easier just to put up a page that way. But if not, LaunchRock enables you to set up a basic landing page with no coding involved. 

On your LaunchRock page you'll have a form where interested visitors can enter their email addresses, so that you can contact them when your site is ready. This way even early on you’ll have a website to point to when people want to know more about your project and when you finally do launch you’ll hopefully already have a list of interested people to contact. 

While LaunchRock is free if you use a subdomain such as "yourawesomebox.launchrock.com", to use your own custom domain like "www.yourawesomebox.com" you will need the $5 / month plan. That's still extremely cheap and I recommend going with the paid plan, because you really should have a custom domain (which maybe you already bought). 

After all you would probably prefer building excitement for your own site, rather than for LaunchRock! 

If you do feel that just the subdomain is enough or want to kick the tires before paying anything, you can proceed with the free account set-up. Some features are not available in the free plan, such as entering custom HTML code.

![Launchrock launch page editor](images/launchrock2.png)

After signing up you’ll have access to a drag and drop site builder, which comes with everything you need to collect email addresses from interested people visiting your site. Later on when your box is ready to accept customers, you can send an email to everyone telling them that they can now go and subscribe to your box. Not everyone will, but a certain percentage of visitors who entered their email will order, giving you an initial boost to get you going.

## Idea validation

You might think of this simple launch page as a way for discovering if people are even interested in what you are offering. Why waste weeks building something, only to discover that no-one cares?

While LaunchRock is fine for getting a rough idea on the number of interested people and many who sign up will likely become subscribers, it's still not quite as good a signal as actually getting paying subscribers.

### Sure, I'd subscribe to that

The trouble with testing ideas without asking for payment is that you can’t really be sure if someone is truly interested, or just humoring you. If you ask "would you subscribe to X if it existed?", many people will answer yes also just because there is no risk or downside for them to agree.

People want to be nice to you. Even if it causes you to waste weeks building something useless. It costs people nothing to agree, but they might risk hurting your feelings if they say no. As SpaceX, PayPal and Tesla (co)founder Elon Musk [often mentions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Bo-RA0sGLU) in his interviews: *"Usually your friends know what’s wrong, but they don’t want to tell you, because they don’t want to hurt you"*.

If you ask someone whether they would subscribe or not, they might say yes, but then go mysteriously silent when it comes time to find their credit card and place an order. It would be better instead to have the most realistic possible test, and that is having just a simple site online where people will actually be able to subscribe. 

### Charge!

This differs from having your real final site open in that it doesn't need to be much better than just your launch page. Just have **something** up so that truly interested people can show that they are serious by actually paying. You can make it better later and convince an even higher percentage of visitors to sign up, but at this point it's still an improvement over just a launch page to have something that feels real with an actual way to pay.

This step is for discovering if people are truly interested in this idea **and** if some will actually pay for it. You can still tweak pricing, your value proposition etc. later, it doesn’t have to be set in stone.

### Make it perfect later

For inspiration, take a look at [how AirBnB gradually improved over the years](http://foundersatwork.posthaven.com/7-important-lesson-from-airbnbs-7-rejections). They put something simple up, then improved it iteratively. You can do the same. It doesn't have to be perfect from the start. 

It's also incredibly motivational to actually have even a handful of people paying you. You'll work harder just so you wouldn't disappoint them.

#### If it fails

What if you collect payments but then cannot actually deliver what you promised, or decide you don’t actually want to pursue your subscription box idea at all? While you do have paying subscribers signed up and it is sad if you must shut down, you can still cancel them and issue refunds. 

I had to do this once when I attempted to start a Japanese stationary subscription box Pen Japan. Although I did manage to get two dozen subscribers, I soon realized I just had no real passion for stationary! When I decided to stop doing it, I made sure everyone either got the orders they had paid for or a refund, then canceled all accounts. Actually that's a free idea for you right there. If you're into both Japan and pens, you could try doing this club. The response was promising.

While it sucks to build up excitement and then not deliver, it beats the alternative of wasting a ton of time building your site only to find out that no-one cares. You can choose to either spend weeks or months of your time perfecting something that falls flat on its face, or possibly slightly disappointing a handful of early customers. 

If you launch early, people will have a chance to show their interest towards your project early on and keep you going. Even if it doesn't pan out, your customers are no worse off, as you can still refund them for any undelivered shipments. 

So if at all possible, you want to validate your idea in as real as possible a way, and what is more real than actually having a site up that can accept payments? 

## Crowdfunding

While I'm going to mostly talk about putting up a static site yourself, another great option recently is to list your project on [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) or [IndieGogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/). Through these crowdfunding platforms, you can get committed paying customers without even having to put up your own website. Not only is it a great way to test if your idea truly has legs, but it can serve as marketing as well.

Both sites allow you to describe your subscription box idea and have people commit to paying for your first boxes. If you get enough orders that way, you'll then know that there is interest towards your concept and can go ahead and launch the actual site. Projects are only funded if they reach their funding goal, so stopping your project is easy if you discover that there is no interest.

The only downside is that at the moment these crowdfunding sites do not support recurring payments. While you can collect initial orders, to have them automatically recur you would then need to reach out to customers and try to get them to re-subscribe to your recurring plan on your site.

## Static site with PayPal subscription buttons

If you are already comfortable with setting up static websites, there is a very easy way to get started with your subscription box site. Simply put up a static site with a PayPal button on it and start promoting it to see what happens. You don’t need to automate anything yet. You can even get the shipping address from PayPal, so it is not necessary to even have any kind of address collection on your site.

### Customizing the subscription button HTML code

After you have your basic button set up, there are additional options available for customizing the button by editing the HTML code, most importantly to change the page users are directed back to after completing their subscription to your own "thank you" page. You can set that one with the hidden form field "return". See the details [here](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/paypal-payments-standard/integration-guide/formbasics/).

In order to keep track of PayPal subscriptions, you can browse your subscribers on the PayPal site and see their shipping addresses there. Their system is not at all geared for subscription boxes however and if you grow larger than 100 subscribers, it will become somewhat awkward to keep track of what you are supposed to be sending to each subscriber. For example it is very very slow to browse your subscriber list on the PayPal site. Predicting future need for stock will be more challenging as well, as frustratingly there is no chart of subscriber growth.

#### Quick and dirty

Even with the limitations, PayPal Payments Standard should be perfectly sufficient for testing the waters to see if people would subscribe to your box. The best thing about it is how easy it is to set up. If you know how to copy & paste code to a static site, you can start accepting subscriptions within a day.

One risk with using these buttons is that it will be more difficult to switch to something else later, as not all support scanning PayPal Payments Standard for new payments from subscriptions started through those simple buttons. Most notably neither of the major subscription box platforms CrateJoy and Subbly supports this.

**PayPal money saving tip**: If you have enough transaction volume, make sure you apply for the [merchant discounts](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_fees-rate-about-outside). For example if you are doing $5000 / month in transactions, you could save $250 / month with just a few clicks.

![](images/paypal_discount.png)

**Another quick tip**: If you hire support staff later on, it is possible to add them as users to PayPal so that they can complete refunds on your behalf. However at least inside Europe this required sending PayPal a scan of their passport or other identity document, but at least the process can be completed online.

#### Downsides 

The problem with using just the standard PayPal subscription buttons is that it doesn't really scale well when you start having hundreds of customers. Customers are slow and cumbersome to find and browse on PayPal's site and there is no easy way to print out all of the shipping labels for example. 

You start dreading customer support questions merely because digging up the necessary information on PayPal will be so painful. Also you'll have no charts over your subscriber growth or retention rates.

With just a static site with PayPal buttons, customers also have no way to update their subscriptions on your site, although changing addresses and cancelling their orders is possible through PayPal. This further increases customer support requests.

Perhaps the biggest reason is that by just using PayPal buttons, you are locked into a relationship with only PayPal. If you have any trouble with them, you could lose access to your subscribers. It might also be better to provide some other payment options for those who do not want to use or cannot use PayPal.

### Leveraging your LaunchRock page

Actually if you tried out LaunchRock, you already have a static site you can use -- your LaunchRock page! Just add a PayPal subscription button to the launch page and bam, you have a rudimentary subscription site. If you get some subscribers this way, they are easy enough to handle manually. If you have a PayPal account, you can find the subscription buttons in the merchant tools.

![Where to find the merchant tools](images/paypal_payments.png)

To get the PayPal subscription button, first create a PayPal account if you don't already have one. Then go to the "Merchant Services" tab and choose "Subscriptions & Recurring Payments". You will just need to choose the name of your subscription product, the currency and monthly charging. After that you get HTML code which you can copy and paste to your static site, resulting in a subscription button. For use with LaunchRock, it may be easier to use the simple link intended for use in emails.

![Setting up the PayPal button](images/paypal_payments_standard.png)

Incidentally, if you already have an email list, you wouldn't even need a website at all, as you can just mail out this link along with an explanation of what your subscription box is about. That is how I got started with Candy Japan.

I just emailed some of the customers of my previous online store to ask if they would be interested in subscribing to a twice-monthly candy service. In the email I just included the PayPal subscription sign-up link in those emails, there was no home page at all.

Since some did subscribe that way, I was encouraged to actually do the effort of setting up a proper website. On the site we used just the same PayPal subscription button for a long time. It was plenty enough to see if anyone would subscribe. Even after we added more payment options later, it did not noticeably increase the amount of subscribers we were getting, so going with just PayPal would probably have worked fine as well.

![Copying the subscription button link from PayPal](images/launchrock3.png)

After creating your button, click on the "email" tab to get a convenient link instead of an HTML snippet. You can use this simple link on your LaunchRock page to create a subscription button. First use the editor to add a button ([here, you can use mine](http://i.imgur.com/v86Zyb6.png)), then click on it to set the link to go to the PayPal subscription page. Now you have a bare-bones working subscription site for only $5/month!

![Pasting subscription link to LaunchRock](images/launchrock4.png)

By the way, these simple recurring payment buttons are called "PayPal Payments Standard". This will be important to know when looking at documentation, as PayPal also has other ways to interface with it. Make sure you are looking at Payments Standard pages, not BrainTree or Express Checkout lest you be confused. The more advanced integration methods Express Checkout requires more technical expertise to use, but allow for a more customized experience. It is only available in certain countries, while Standard Payments has better global availability.

### Going with SquareSpace

If you are not comfortable coding up your own site and LaunchRock didn't seem attractive to you, another easy way to set up a static site is by using an online content management system such as [SquareSpace](http://www.squarespace.com). 

Calling it a "content management system" makes it sound a bit scary, but really it’s just a way to easily drag and drop your page layout together while adding some content to your pages.

You can use ready-made templates that work on mobile as well. 

#### Dragging and dropping or just a drag?

If you want to get pixel-perfectionist about arranging your site, you may find that the drag and drop interface won't let you do everything you might want to do. But as long as you are satisfied going along with what the template author had in mind, you'll be golden. More accurately arranging your site will require editing the templates manually. For roughly arranging images, text and buttons as you want it is enough to just drag things around using the visual interface. 

As a test to try out the SquareSpace site designer, I attempted to remake our current site for Candy Japan. I initially hand-coded it in HTML and now wanted to get the same result by just dragging and dropping. In a few hours I was able to remake the main page to be somewhat like the the current design, but it was quite hard to get it exactly right. I found that some things such as arranging buttons next to each other as I wanted wasn’t easy to do precisely using the interface, but for a basic layout it should be more than sufficient. 

Who knows, perhaps those limitations are even useful as they can help prevent you from making an ugly arrangement of components even if you have no eye for visual design. In particular many SquareSpace designs are a lot more whitespace-heavy than I would feel is necessary, which probably means my feeling is wrong and that SquareSpace is forcing me to do the right thing :-)

### Using 99designs to have designers compete on your site design

What if you want a cool custom design, but have no design sense and/or no HTML skills?

Besides hiring a designer directly or learning HTML yourself, another option is to have your site layout made by starting a design competition on [99designs](http://99designs.com). On the site each designer can submit their own work and then you pick the one you liked the most. Besides whole site designs, 99designs can also be used for other work, such as logos and packaging design.

For instance the cover of the book you are reading was designed through such a contest (thank you [OberonZG](https://en.99designs.jp/profiles/1273461)). You can see [some of the other cover designs that were submitted](https://en.99designs.jp/book-cover-design/contests/create-e-book-cover-subscription-boxes-502795/overview). I had so many good options it was tough to choose.

![Winning design](images/99designs.png)

Using 99designs requires a bit of an investment, but is still quite cheap considering the amount of total work you will be getting from several designers. 

The price depends on how many designers you want competing, but prices go from around $500 for 15 designs to $1500 for 35 designs. 

There are additional optional fees (up-sells!) for getting more promotion for your contest, such as having @99designs tweet about your contest or promote it in their newsletter. The add-ons are sold quite convincingly and I could not resist using some of the up-sells, so you might want to assume that you will end up paying a bit extra.

#### How it works

The 99designs process goes as follows. First you start your contest by explaining the kind of design you are looking for in as much detail as possible. To host the cover contest for this book, I submitted my own extremely rough sketch on what the cover might look like. Just describing your idea in words is enough, but I wanted to be extra clear. Then some time passed and I started getting several first draft designs coming in. 

From the early drafts I could give the designers feedback, so that they could continue  perfecting their designs. From there I could then select my top favorite designs. At this point the top submitters still have time to make their designs even better, until finally you pick the best one. The winner gets awarded by prize money for their work, but you will also have an option to buy other runners-up in case you might want to use their work later.

## Extending an online shopping cart system

Instead of just slapping a PayPal button on a static site, using a proper e-commerce cart system would let your customers manage their orders more easily without having to contact you by e-mail to view their order status. You could also browse your orders, mark them shipped and have automatic emails sent to customers. 

While there are completely dedicated systems geared for subscription box sites, for completeness here are some of the more traditional cart systems which can be extended to support subscription boxes as well.

### WooCommerce Subscriptions

WooCommerce is an open source e-commerce plugin for the website creation tool (or CMS) called WordPress. While WooCommerce allows you to create an online store, it does not support recurring subscriptions by default. WooCommerce Subscriptions is an add-on which exists to add this support. With this combination, you can set up your own subscription box site on top of WooCommerce.

![BlueHost offers WooCommerce hosting](images/bluehost.png)

WooCommerce Subscriptions has a flat purchase price of $199, after which you can continue using it for free. The catch is that you have to be familiar with hosting your own website, or have someone do it for you. There are hosting services which make things easier, such as [BlueHost](http://www.bluehost.com/wordpress-woocommerce) which supports both WooCommerce and WooCommerce Subscriptions. Such hosting will cost roughly $15/month, depending on the kind of plan you would likely need. [SiteGround also offers WooCommerce hosting](https://www.siteground.com/shared-hosting-features.htm).

### Extending Shopify to support a subscription box

Not originally geared for subscription boxes, [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com) is an ecommerce system for starting online stores. Bonus fact: Shopify [was originally created to run a single snowboarding shop](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/meet-our-ceo-of-the-year/article21734931/), but has since grown to handle multiple stores and $8 billion worth of sales. 

Shopify costs $29/month and has gateway fees identical with Stripe, but with volume discounts for higher sales. By default Shopify does not support recurring payments, but it can be extended to do that by using apps. 

You can see a quick price comparison chart of the apps below. The chart assumes you have a product which you are charging $29/month for and shows how much various Shopify billing apps would cost at different subscriber counts. On top of this cost you would also need to pay Shopify's own fees.

![](images/shopify_apps_chart.png)

#### Chargify

One of the recurring payment apps is [Chargify](https://apps.shopify.com/chargify). By combining Shopify and Chargify, you have a system suitable for running a subscription box. Chargify pricing is $65 for up to 20 customers, $129 for up to 500 and $459 for up to 2,000. 

![Chargify dashboard screenshot from their documentation](images/chargify_screenshot.png)

#### PayWhirl

Another option for adding a subscription layer to Shopify is PayWhirl, which is used for example by the soap subscription box [JFSoaperie](http://www.jfsoaperie.com/soapscription). PayWhirl is priced to have two tiers, either $0/month + 2% per transaction or $49/month + 1% per transaction.

![PayWhirl dashboard screenshot from their documentation](images/paywhirl_screenshot.png)

You can find [PayWhirl in the Shopify app directory](https://apps.shopify.com/paywhirl-recurring-payments) or on [PayWhirl’s own site](http://www.paywhirl.com). Besides Shopify, PayWhirl can also be used in other contexts, [such as with SquareSpace](http://blog.paywhirl.com/blog/post/how-sockscapade-uses-paywhirl-to-power-their-online-monthly-sock-subscription-business).

If your subscription plan is $29/month, then at 20 subscribers PayWhirl would cost only $11.60/month compared to Chargify’s $65, so it is cheaper to start with. At this plan when having a bit under 500 subscribers it would become more expensive, but it would be quite a trivial difference. You should be choosing the system rather based on which you feel is easier to use and most of all the better user experience for your customers.

#### ReCharge

![ReCharge dashboard](images/recharge_2.png)

There also exists an app called [ReCharge](https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-recurring-payments), which is designed to be used both as a "subscribe & save" -type feature similar to Amazon or as the engine for subscription boxes. The [introduction video on their app page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNm1s_vU8N0) is excellent, I recommend checking it out. ReCharge is $19.99/month + 1% per transaction for up to 500 subscribers, with a negotiable discount if you have a larger customer base.

![ReCharge subscription plan set-up screen](images/recharge_1.png)

With ReCharge all recurring subscriptions appear as new orders within Shopify, with special new interfaces for managing them both for you and your customer. You can change the subscriptions and update credit cards etc. through the interface which ReCharge adds to your Shopify. It also sends notification emails (welcome email, charge failed and charge succeeded) to your customers automatically. ReCharge supports monthly and other frequencies.

#### ChargeBee

The options don't stop there. Another subscriptions app which works with Shopify is [ChargeBee](https://apps.shopify.com/chargebee-recurring-billing?ref=shopstorm), priced in tiers based on how many monthly invoices you have. Starting at $49/month for 50 invoices, going to $79 for 200 with finally $249 for 2000. For monthly charges ChargeBee creates its own invoices instead of making normal Shopify orders, but on the other hand it supports several payment processors.

![ChargeBee dashboard screenshot from their documentation](images/chargebee_screenshot.jpg)

### Going with PrestaShop or Magento

Besides Shopify, there are many other shopping cart systems which you can extend with a subscription module. For instance you could use [PrestaShop](https://www.prestashop.com/) and extend it with the [Subscriptions Module](http://addons.prestashop.com/en/advertising-marketing-newsletter-modules/5031-subscriptions.html) add-on. Or go with [Magento](http://magento.com/) shopping cart system and extend it with the [Subscriptions and Recurring Payments plugin](http://ecommerce.aheadworks.com/magento-extensions/subscriptions-and-recurring-payments.html).

PrestaShop add-on for subscriptions costs 99,99 EUR, while the Magento Subscriptions and Recurring Payments extension costs $299. In the long run either will be a lot cheaper than the monthly fees many dedicated subscription platforms have. But in the end you should not decide based on just the price, as either will only be a small part of the cost of your box and you should go with the solution that feels like the best fit, not necessarily the cheapest one.

## Subscription e-commerce platforms

Using a normal ecommerce cart system which has been extended to support subscriptions might work out OK, but will likely not be as pleasant to use for you or your customers as an integrated solution which has been designed from the ground up for subscription boxes, without it merely being an afterthought. 

Going with a company completely dedicated to subscription ecommerce means that they will be optimizing their systems to help retain customers as long as possible and have a good interface for customers to manage their subscriptions.

To help in all of these matters, there are now several platforms which can offer an integrated experience for you. You can hook up different payment methods, such as credit card payment gateways so that customers can enter their credit card information directly on your site without going through a third-party service. 

### Member zone and streamlined shipping

Your customers will be able to update their accounts and see the shipping status of their orders right on your site. Some of these systems even make it possible to buy postage stamps to print directly on your shipments with your own desktop printer.

There are several such subscription e-commerce platforms in existence now, perhaps the most famous one being CrateJoy. I will not go too deeply into the set-up of each of these, as you can find much better information in their own documentation and websites. But just as an overview, I will list a few of the options that are out there. 

Among the most important aspects when comparing ways to set up your subscription site are:

* Provided layout templates / editor
* Supported payment methods
* Ease of preparing shipments
* Ease of set-up
* Cost of the platform
* App/extension ecosystem

### Provided layout templates / editor

The success of your site will be highly impacted by the conversion ratio of your landing page - getting visitors to convert to customers. If you need 100 visitors to get one customer, you will be radically better off than a competitor who needs 200 visitors for the same gain. How you design your site will have a big impact on how well your visitors will convert to customers. Full solutions will already come with proven templates to choose from.

Besides just the attractive layout, things like copywriting, photos and video on your site will of course also have a huge impact on how effectively your site sells. To make sure you can easily keep your site updated, the template should be easy to edit. Either by having slots where you can place your desired text or images, or an easy-to-use editor that allows you to drag components around.

In practice it will be impossible to know which layout will work for you, so it should also be possible to customize the site freely by editing HTML/CSS directly if need be. That does not necessarily have to be something you would do yourself, but you should have the option of being able to hire a freelancer to do any detailed changes which you need.

### Supported payment methods

There are many ways to pay online. You can have a form on your site where users can enter credit cards directly, similar to Amazon and many other online stores. While this can make your site look very professional, another fine option is to take your customers over to PayPal to complete their payment. 

Some customers prefer to enter their cards directly, others are comforted by having a trusted third party appear between the site and their purchase. Some are even [against PayPal on principle](http://www.paypalsucks.com/), although personally I have never had a single problem with PayPal after ~5 years of accepting payments through them.

#### Gateways

When accepting credit cards directly, your payment gateway will affect the processing fees you pay. Gateways can offer other services as well, such as fraud detection. The gateway Candy Japan uses is a German company called [WireCard](http://wirecard.com/).

Recently the most popular gateway for subscription boxes is Stripe. It is very smooth to use for the customer, as their credit card information is often already pre-filled. The way that works is that if the customer has previously used Stripe to purchase somewhere else, the payment details are remembered for future purchases on other stores.

However the downside of Stripe is that while they accept merchants from most countries, not all are supported. You can see the currently supported Stripe countries [here](https://stripe.com/global). Your customers can be anywhere, but as a merchant you need to be in one of the supported countries. 

PayPal also restricts their more advanced payment APIs to some countries only, while PayPal Payments Standard (the simple subscription buttons) is more widely available.

If there is a certain payment gateway you wish to use, for example if you are based in Russia and need to use a local payment provider, then you would need to find a subscription e-commerce platform which also supports that gateway. 

If you are US-based, congratulations: you have a lot of choice. In some countries you might be happy just to find any working way for accepting payments. In my case as a sole-proprietor foreigner living in Japan, I couldn't initially find any gateway which would accept me, until I found [WireCard](https://www.wirecard.com/).

### Ease of preparing shipments

As shipping out stuff is a repetitive step which you will need to do every single month (if not more), it should be as easy as possible. There are different ways to schedule your shipments, which will affect how your day-to-day shipping activity will go. 

If you send in batches, you definitely don't want to have to write labels by hand once you get past a few dozen subscribers. After a few hundred, even clicking one-by-one to generate each label starts to get tedious. For Candy Japan our shipping list is one big PDF file with over a hundred pages, which then gets printed on shipping labels in one go. 

### Ease of set-up

While other aspects will eventually dominate in importance, ease of set-up matters too, as otherwise you might give up on your box idea before it goes anywhere. You are much more likely to remain motivated to continue with your project if you can get to the point of having the first few subscribers. 

That means setting up a simple site which can accept payments should be as painless as possible. If you are working on this project alone, your likelihood of going through with it will be much less if you need to set up your own server and configure software to get started. Luckily there are now good solutions which require minimal effort to set up.

### Cost of the platform

You might be tempted to focus on the cost alone, but while important, you might want to put more weight on other considerations. For example if subscription platform A costs $50 / month and platform B is $100 / month, if B brought you just one extra customer each month or saved just a bit of your time, then it would very likely already be worth the difference.

The systems tend to be priced such that the cost scales as your customer base grows, often with a base fee and an additional per-transaction fee. Any of the commonly available platforms is cheap enough that the cost is not much of an issue and your expenses will be likely dominated by other costs such as shipping and marketing expenses.

As a point of comparison, if you hired a web developer to make an entirely new subscription system just for you, that alone could easily cost tens of thousands of dollars. You should feel very lucky that there are now platforms that accomplish the same with a fraction of the cost of custom development.

### App/extension ecosystem

Similar to how smartphones have their own app ecosystems, the same is emerging for subscription e-commerce platforms as well. If you go with a bigger player, your app selection will likely be larger as well.

This is not a big consideration at the moment, but going with a well-known provider which has a good developer community will make it more likely that any useful add-ons will be available to you in the future.

## CrateJoy

CrateJoy is an Austin, Texas based subscription e-commerce company. With CrateJoy you can both host your site, do recurring billing, see analytics about your subscribers, send automatic customer emails and even print postage stamps, all using the same online interface. In addition to subscription products, CrateJoy also offers traditional ecommerce-style one-time products, so you can also have a shop on your site.

CrateJoy founder Amir Elaguizy [has estimated that out of the 10,000+ subscription boxes on the market 4,000 use CrateJoy](http://www.fastcompany.com/3044527/most-creative-people/from-socks-to-sex-toys-inside-americas-subscription-box-obsession). In addition to the CrateJoy system itself, they also run [Subscription School](http://subscriptionschool.com/), which is another excellent resource for monthly box entrepreneurs, especially when you have decided to go with CrateJoy.

CrateJoy was started as part of the startup incubator Y Combinator (which by the way accepts applications [here](http://www.ycombinator.com/) in case you need funding, although it is not easy to get accepted). In each funding round they have multiple companies receiving investment simultaneously and attending startup dinners together. Amir was [inspired to start CrateJoy](http://socialnerdia.com/blog/cratejoy-founder-amir-elaguizy) upon noticing how well the subscription box companies in the incubator were doing. 

Despite the success of those subscription boxes, there was still no great solution available for running them. Many were operating their businesses using various systems not really geared for subscription sites. From the start CrateJoy was specifically targeting to make a better solution than the Shopify + Chargify combination.

### Giving it a go

For over 4 years we have been running our subscription box Candy Japan with a self-made system. How can I then write about CrateJoy properly, if I'm not even using it? To address this dilemma, I bought another subscription box business, a small monthly Japanese anime box called [FaniPack](http://www.fanipack.com), which had already been running on CrateJoy.

The staff at CrateJoy helped me transition the site from the previous owner. I have been using CrateJoy to run FaniPack for three months now, and must say I find it a joy to use. Compared with our own system, CrateJoy provides quite a natural interface for managing subscriptions. With an in-house system, you tend not to really care much about how nice your user interface is.

When you’re the only one using it, at first the interface doesn’t really matter. But when you keep using your system for years and then eventually want to have other people helping you or want to even sell your business, it starts to matter much more. CrateJoy is a lot more pleasant to use than our in-house one, which lacks even navigation menus (hey, I can remember the URLs!).

### Templates / editor

CrateJoy has a "design store" where you can purchase site templates for use in your subscription box site. After you purchase and install a template, you can edit the text and images to your liking via a visual editor, called the "designer". If needed, even images can be edited directly on CrateJoy, as they integrate the browser-based Aviary image editor.

![CrateJoy designer](images/cratejoy_designer.png)

Now I must admit that when I actually did some edits on my own CrateJoy subscription site, I wanted to change some things that turned out to be impossible to do through the visual editor. For example the top menu had "FAQ" and "Shop" tabs that I wanted to remove, but there seemed to be no way to do that from the editor and I had to go edit the HTML directly.

Luckily HTML/CSS can be freely edited using the built-in code editor, or by accessing the template through FTP. For dynamic parts CrateJoy uses the jinja templating language. Sections can be marked as editable, which makes it possible to change them via the designer, without touching any code. In the end it was possible to do my desired edits using the online HTML editor with minimum fuss, but if you didn't know HTML, then at this point you might have needed to ask someone to help you. 

### Supported payment gateways

The default gateway offered on CrateJoy is Stripe and you are highly encouraged to use it. While it is unlikely to be a coincidence that both Stripe and CrateJoy are backed by the same startup accelerator, Stripe does genuinely seem like an excellent choice for accepting payments. 

In addition to Stripe, CrateJoy also supports the payment gateways Authorize.net, PayTrace, BrainTree, PayMill, WorldPay and CyberSource. However [Stripe support suggests going with Stripe](https://cratejoy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201885619-What-payment-processors-does-Cratejoy-support-) in these words: *"We strongly recommend usage of Stripe and will only enable a non-stripe payment processor when there is a good reason to do so (such as being in a non-stripe supported country)."*.

Note the absence of PayPal. Switching to CrateJoy if you already have a lot of existing PayPal subscribers could be challenging.

While Stripe payments can be accepted from any country, you as the merchant must be located in a country supported by Stripe. At the time of writing the supported merchant countries were Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. There are other countries where Stripe is in beta. You can find the up-to-date list on [Stripe's site](https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-countries-does-stripe-support).

One of the best things about Stripe is that if your potential customer has already bought something from another site using the Stripe gateway, they can prefill their credit card details. This means that to order the customer won't have to refill their CC number, but it can be a matter of just clicking "OK". This is fantastic, as the less friction you have in your checkout flow the better in terms of your conversion rate from visitor to customer.

### Managing shipments

Through the CrateJoy shipments interface you are able to see the boxes you are currently supposed to mail out. This also includes any confirmed orders you have for future months, in case you sell multiple month subscriptions (pre-payments for several months in advance). For example if it is before the July box cut-off date and a customer puts in a 3-month box order, then you would already be able to see them as a confirmed order for August as well. 

However if the subscriber is paying monthly, then their order would not show up until the rebill has gone through. This is because they might still cancel or their credit card could stop working before the payment has a chance to clear, so it is not certain yet if there really will be an order.

![CrateJoy shipments view](images/cratejoy_shipments.png)

An interesting feature is that you can print labels *including postage* directly from the app. Instead of affixing stamps to your boxes yourself or have the post office measure and stamp them, proof of stamp payment is printed out as QR codes on the label. That means you can neatly have just one label for the recipient and sender addresses with postage included in it as well.

### Pricing

At the time of writing CrateJoy charged $39.00 / month and additionally 1.25% + $0.10 for each transaction. 

If you had 100 subscribers paying $29 each month, that would mean CrateJoy costs you $39.00 + (100*$29)*0.0125 + 100 * $0.10 = $85.25.

This does not include payment gateway fees. If Stripe is your gateway, then in the example case they would additionally charge you $114.10 (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction).

### Apps

At the moment CrateJoy had an app store with a handful of apps in it. As the service is growing rapidly, the growth of the app store looks promising. All of the apps were free, with only exception being a "referral program" app which was priced at $99/month.

### More to read on CrateJoy

While having a detailed CrateJoy set-up guide might be a good addition to this book, it could never be as up to date and authoritative as [their own tutorials](http://subscriptionschool.com/), so I suggest going directly to the source to learn more about CrateJoy if you are interested in setting it up.

## Subbly

Subbly is a subscription e-commerce platform founded by Stefan Pretty. It is designed to make starting a subscription business as painless as possible.

As [Subbly's blog puts it](http://www.subbly.co/blog/what-is-subbly-5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-subscription-box-ecommerce-platform/) "*Subbly is an all-in-one subscription eCommerce solution that provides vendors with everything they need to set up a subscription box business on one simple platform.*".

Subbly team prides themselves on great support, including personal help to grow your business. When I set up my own Subbly test site I was even offered a free consultation session with the founder, although that might have been a time-limited offer.

### Templates / editor

At the time of writing there were two templates to choose from, both free. Subbly can also design your site template for you. The cost for this design service starts at $2500.

Designing your site with one of the provided templates is a matter of choosing a logo and customizing which font and colors you would like. You can also include links to your social media presence. Next you can start entering the text to describe how your box works, its name, tagline and so on. To see the changes you save and refresh your shop.

![Customizing your site template on Subbly](images/subbly_editor.png)

With the old editor you could not edit texts by just clicking on them, but you could see the editable texts side-by-side with your live site. It seems that Subbly has also recently been shifting more towards a visual editor. When I tested it, instead of clicking on the text you want to change, you need to find the right place in theme options to change your desired part. This was actually not that unintuitive, as having all the options clearly listed in front of you makes it very clear which parts are editable.

### Supported payment gateways

At the time of writing Subbly only supported Stripe, although that is what CrateJoy is also strongly pushing merchants to use.

### Managing shipments

When scheduling shipments you can select billing intervals and delivery intervals (weekly, monthly, every 3 months, annually or bi-annually), but cannot freely choose a cut-off date to lock your shipping list in preparation for a shipment. 

![Shipment preparation screen](images/subbly_dispatch.png)

### Pricing

Subbly is tiered based on subscriber count. Up to 10 subscribers for $24/month, 100 for $49/month, 300 for $99/month, 1000 for $199/month. There are no transaction fees.

In most cases that is significantly cheaper than CrateJoy. Here is a comparison of CrateJoy vs. Subbly pricing, assuming a box which costs $29/month. The comparison does not include gateway fees, but those would be the same if you use Stripe for both.

![CrateJoy vs. Subbly pricing](images/pricing.png)

### Apps

Subbly has no third-party app directory, but it does have ShipStation integration. ShipStation is a web-based software for handling shipments, through which you can integrate with USPS, UPS, FedEx and DHL. It is ideal when you are selling goods through multiple channels, for example if you have an online store selling the same products that your subscription box site is selling, you can use ShipStation to have just one shipment flow. It also helps you print labels.

Zapier integration is coming soon. Zapier is a bit similar to IFTTT, providing an interface for creating triggered automations. For example Zapier could send you an email, iOS notification or a Slack message when an order comes in. There are many possibilities to use it to trigger useful actions, as Zapier can interact with almost anything.
